	abstract = {Conventional wound dressings are difficult to apply to large total body surface area (TBSA) wounds, as they typically are prefabricated, require a layer of adhesive coating for fixation, and need frequent replacement for entrapped exudate. Large TBSA wounds as well as orthopedic trauma and low-resource surgery also have a high risk of infection. In this report, a sprayable and intrinsically adhesive wound dressing loaded with antimicrobial silver is investigated that provides personalized fabrication with minimal patient contact. The dressing is composed of adhesive and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA/PEG) blend fibers with or without silver salt (AgNO3). in vitro studies demonstrate that the PLGA/PEG/Ag dressing has antimicrobial properties and low cytotoxicity, with antimicrobial silver controllably released over 7–14 days. In a porcine partial-thickness wound model, the wounds treated with both antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial PLGA/PEG dressings heal at rates similar to those of the clinical, thin film polyurethane wound dressing, with similar scarring. However, PLGA/PEG adds a number of features beneficial for wound healing: greater exudate absorption, integration into the wound, a 25\% reduction in dressing changes, and tissue regeneration with greater vascularization. There is also modest improvement in epidermis thickness compared to the control wound dressing.},
