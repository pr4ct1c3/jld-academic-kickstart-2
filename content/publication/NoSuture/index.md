abstract: "This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of solution blow spun polymer (BSP) for sealing bowel perforations in a mouse model of partial cecal transection. We then evaluated its use for reinforcing a surgical anastomosis in a preclinical piglet model. Outcome measures included anastomotic burst pressure, anastomotic leak rate, 14-day survival, and complication rate. The mean burst pressure at 24h was significantly higher for BSP (81mm Hg) when compared to fibrin glue (6mm Hg, p=0.047) or PEG hydrogel (10mm Hg, p=0.047), and comparable to cyanoacrylate (64mm Hg, p=0.91). Further preclinical testing is warranted to better understand BSP properties and alternative surgical applications."
