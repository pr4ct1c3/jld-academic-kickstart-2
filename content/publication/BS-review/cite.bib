	abstract = {Solution blow spinning (SBS) is a technique that can be used to deposit fibers in situ at low cost for a variety of applications, which include biomedical materials and flexible electronics. This review is intended to provide an overview of the basic principles and applications of SBS. We first describe a method for creating a spinnable polymer solution and stable polymer solution jet by manipulating parameters such as polymer concentration and gas pressure. This method is based on fundamental insights, theoretical models, and empirical studies. We then discuss the unique bundled morphology and mechanical properties of fiber mats produced by SBS, and how they compare with electrospun fiber mats. Applications of SBS in biomedical engineering are highlighted, showing enhanced cell infiltration and proliferation versus electrospun fiber scaffolds and in situ deposition of biodegradable polymers. We also discuss the impact of SBS in applications involving textiles and electronics, including ceramic fibers and conductive composite materials. Strategies for future research are presented that take advantage of direct and rapid polymer deposition via cost-effective methods.},
