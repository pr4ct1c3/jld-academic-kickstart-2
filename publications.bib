	shorttitle = {Bioadhesion and {Biomimetics}},
	abstract = {Bioadhesion is often defined as the state in which two materials, at least one of which is biological in nature, are held together for extended periods of time by interfacial forces. It is an area of active multidisciplinary research, where engineers, scientists—including chemists, physicists, biologists, and medical experts—materials’ producers, and manufacturers combine their knowledge. From the practical point of view, bioadhesive systems have been used for several years for medical applications such as dentistry and orthopedics and are now entering new fields, for example, tissue sealing and directed drug delivery systems. Understanding bioadhesion mechanisms is of prime importance while exploring desired adhesion for bioadhesion applications such as sealants as well as successful prevention of undesired adhesion of biomolecules, cells, or organisms. Controlling the occurrence of bioadhesion events is also an important problem in the design and use of medical devices, biosensors, membranes, ships, and oil rigs.  This book provides a comprehensive view of bioadhesion and highlights different aspects of this phenomenon. The first section of the book presents fundamentals aspects of bioadhesion. It also summarizes various direct and indirect methods used to investigate and characterize bioadhesion. The second section describes studies of natural adhesives. These include "wet" adhesives that are produced and secreted by sessile marine organisms such as mussels and sand tubes and "dry" adhesives such as the one characterizing the gecko foot. The third section focuses on biomimetic adhesives. These man-made materials are fabricated on the basis of the lessons learned from nature emphasizing the correlation between nature understanding and biomimetics. Finally, the last section reviews medical applications of adhesive materials, which include surgical sealants, mucoadhesive drug delivery vehicles, and prevention of adhesion on medical devices.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes such as 3D printing use time-consuming, stepwise layer-by-layer approaches to object fabrication. We demonstrate the continuous generation of monolithic polymeric parts up to tens of centimeters in size with feature resolution below 100 micrometers. Continuous liquid interface production is achieved with an oxygen-permeable window below the ultraviolet image projection plane, which creates a “dead zone” (persistent liquid interface) where photopolymerization is inhibited between the window and the polymerizing part. We delineate critical control parameters and show that complex solid parts can be drawn out of the resin at rates of hundreds of millimeters per hour. These print speeds allow parts to be produced in minutes instead of hours.
Fast, continuous, 3D printing
Although three-dimensional (3D) printing is now possible using relatively small and low-cost machines, it is still a fairly slow process. This is because 3D printers require a series of steps to cure, replenish, and reposition themselves for each additive cycle. Tumbleston et al. devised a process to effectively grow solid structures out of a liquid bath. The key to the process is the creation of an oxygen-containing “dead zone” between the solid part and the liquid precursor where solidification cannot occur. The precursor liquid is then renewed by the upward movement of the growing solid part. This approach made structures tens of centimeters in size that could contain features with a resolution below 100 µm.

	abstract = {Driven by market demand, many biological and synthetic scaffolds have been developed during the last 15 years. Both positive and negative results have been reported in clinical applications for tendon and ligament repair. To obtain data for this review, multiple electronic databases were used (e.g., Pubmed and ScienceDirect), as well as the US FDA website and the reference lists from clinical trials, review articles and company reports, in order to identify studies relating to the use of these commercial scaffolds for tendon and ligament repair. The commercial names of each scaffold and the keywords ‘tendon’ and ‘ligament’ were used as the search terms. Initially, 378 articles were identified. Of these, 47 were clinical studies and the others were reviews, editorials, commentaries, animal studies or related to applications other than tendons and ligaments. The outcomes were reviewed in 47 reports (six on Restore™, eight on Graftjacket®, four on Zimmer®, one on TissueMend®, five on Gore-Tex®, six on Lars®, 18 on Leeds–Keio® and one study used both Restore and Graftjacket). The advantages, disadvantages and future perspectives regarding the use of commercial scaffolds for tendon and ligament treatment are discussed. Both biological and synthetic scaffolds can cause adverse events such as noninfectious effusion and synovitis, which result in the failure of surgery. Future improvements should focus on both mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Nanoscaffold manufactured using electrospinning technology may provide great improvement in future practice.},

Gold NPs (Dcore = 15.8 ± 1.3 nm) bearing poly(4-vinylphenol) ligands were selectively incorporated within the hydrophilic domains of a phase-separated (polynorbornene-g-polystyrene)-b-(polynorbornene-g-poly(ethylene oxide)) copolymer via hydrogen bonding between the phenol groups on gold and the PEO side chains of the brush block copolymer. Well-ordered NP arrays with an inverse cylindrical morphology were readily generated through an NP-driven order?order transition of the brush block copolymer.},

@book{ferry_viscoelastic_1980,
	title = {Viscoelastic {Properties} of {Polymers}},
	isbn = {978-0-471-04894-7},
	abstract = {Viscoelastic behavior reflects the combined viscous and elastic responses, under mechanical stress, of materials which are intermediate between liquids and solids in character. Polymers—the basic materials of the rubber and plastic industries and important to the textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries as well—exhibit viscoelasticity to a pronounced degree. Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the final products of these industries, and also the success of processing methods at intermediate stages of production. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers examines, in detail, the effects of the many variables on which the basic viscoelastic properties depend. These include temperature, pressure, and time; polymer chemical composition, molecular weight and weight distribution, branching and crystallinity; dilution with solvents or plasticizers; and mixture with other materials to form composite systems. With guidance by molecular theory, the dependence of viscoelastic properties on these variables can be simplified by introducing certain ancillary concepts such as the fractional free volume, the monomeric friction coefficient, and the spacing between entanglement loci, to provide a qualitative understanding and in many cases a quantitative prediction of how to achieve desired results. The phenomenological theory of viscoelasticity—which permits interrelation of the results of different types of experiments—is presented first, with many useful approximation procedures for calculations given. A wide variety of experimental methods is then described, with critical evaluation of their applicability to polymeric materials of different consistencies and in different regions of the time scale (or, for oscillating deformations, the frequency scale). A review of the present state of molecular theory follows, so that viscoelasticity can be related to the motions of flexible polymer molecules and their entanglements and network junctions. The dependence of viscoelastic properties on temperature and pressure, and its descriptions using reduced variables, are discussed in detail. Several chapters are then devoted to the dependence of viscoelastic properties on chemical composition, molecular weight, presence of diluents, and other features, for several characteristic classes of polymer materials. Finally, a few examples are given to illustrate the many potential applications of these principles to practical problems in the processing and use of rubbers, plastics, and fibers, and in the control of vibration and noise. The third edition has been brought up to date to reflect the important developments, in a decade of exceptionally active research, which have led to a wider use of polymers, and a wider recognition of the importance and range of application of viscoelastic properties. Additional data have been incorporated, and the book’s chapters on dilute solutions, theory of undiluted polymers, plateau and terminal zones, cross-linked polymers, and concentrated solutions have been extensively rewritten to take into account new theories and new experimental results. Technical managers and research workers in the wide range of industries in which polymers play an important role will find that the book provides basic information for practical applications, and graduate students in chemistry and engineering will find, in its illustrations with real data and real numbers, an accessible introduction to the principles of viscoelasticity.},

	abstract = {An elastomer is a polymer with viscoelasticity (having both viscosity and elasticity) and very weak inter-molecular forces, generally having low Young's modulus and high failure strain compared with other materials. The term, which is derived from elastic polymer, is often used interchangeably with the term rubber, although the latter is preferred when referring to vulcanisates. Each of the monomers which link to form the polymer is usually made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and/or silicon. Elastomers are amorphous polymers existing above their glass transition temperature, so that considerable segmental motion is possible. At ambient temperatures, rubbers are thus relatively soft (E{\textasciitilde}3MPa) and deformable. Their primary uses are for seals, adhesives and molded flexible parts. Application areas for different types of rubber are manifold and cover segments as diverse as tires, shoe soles as well as dampening and insulating elements. The importance rubbers have can be judged from the fact that global revenues are forecast to rise to US\$56 billion in 2020.},

	abstract = {Unstabilized poly(ether block amide) (PEBA, PEBAX) of the type used in angioplasty balloons was aged at temperatures of 18–85°C for periods of up to 313 days. Since PEBA is used in safety critical applications, understanding the effects and underlying mechanisms of ageing and the validity of accelerated ageing protocols is vital. Mechanical testing indicated an increase in modulus during ageing consistent with embrittlement. An activation energy (Ea) of 47.3 kJ mol−1 was calculated over the temperature range 18–45°C and increased deviation from linear Arrhenius behavior observed above 45°C. This value of Ea would result in the commonly applied 10°C rule over estimating shelf life. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography, and thermal analysis provided evidence that the observed property changes were largely the result of oxidative damage and crystallinity effects. The data presented provides a rational basis for the use of accelerated testing protocols at temperatures of up to 45°C to generate room temperature shelf life estimates. POLYM. ENG.

	abstract = {Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) can be useful in the repair of congenital or acquired valvular diseases due to their potential for growth and remodeling. The development of biomimetic scaffolds is a major challenge in heart valve tissue engineering. One of the most important structural characteristics of mature heart valve leaflets is their intrinsic anisotropy, which is derived from the microstructure of aligned collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the present study, a directional electrospinning technique is used to fabricate fibrous poly(glycerol sebacate):poly(caprolactone) (PGS:PCL) scaffolds containing aligned fibers, which resemble native heart valve leaflet ECM networks. In addition, the anisotropic mechanical characteristics of fabricated scaffolds are tuned by changing the ratio of PGS:PCL to mimic the native heart valve's mechanical properties. Primary human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) attach and align along the anisotropic axes of all PGS:PCL scaffolds with various mechanical properties. The cells are also biochemically active in producing heart-valve-associated collagen, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin as determined by gene expression. The fibrous PGS:PCL scaffolds seeded with human VICs mimick the structure and mechanical properties of native valve leaflet tissues and would potentially be suitable for the replacement of heart valves in diverse patient populations.},

Airbrushing, a proposed alternative to traditional electrospinning, is a technique capable of synthesizing open structure nanofiber scaffolds at high rates. In this study, three biocompatible polymers—poly-D,L-lactic acid (P-DL-LA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), were airbrushed to form networks for bone tissue regeneration. All three polymers were loaded with up to 20\% (w/w) zirconium-modified amorphous calcium phosphate (Zr-ACP). A simple one-step mix and straightforward material deposition yielded open structure networks with well-distributed Zr-ACP. Cell penetration within the airbrushed scaffolds was found to be more than twice the cell penetration within conventional electrospun networks. The airbrushed polymer network supported cell growth and differentiation. Cells grown on the Zr-ACP in P-DL-LA fibers exhibited improved levels of osteocalcin protein with an increase in the Zr-ACP content by day 16. This airbrushing method promises to be a viable and attractive alternative to currently used electrospinning techniques in the formation of composite 3D nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.},

	abstract = {Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fails to heal after traumatic rupture. Furthermore, large-animal models have recently shown that 1-month functional ACL healing is augmented after suture repair when a bioactive scaffold is placed in the tear site.
Hypothesis At the time of suture repair, placement of a bioactive scaffold in the ACL wound site would improve the structural properties of the tissue.
Study Design Controlled laboratory study.
Methods Twenty-seven knees in immature pigs underwent ACL transection and suture repair. A collagen-platelet composite (CPC) was used to supplement the repair in 14 knees. Knees were harvested at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Mechanical testing and histologic analysis were performed.
Results The addition of a CPC to a suture repair resulted in improvements in yield load and linear stiffness of the repair tissue at 3 months, as well as a significant increase in cell density. A reduction in yield load and stiffness occurred at the 6-week time point in both groups, a phase when revascularization was noted.
Conclusion The addition of a CPC to a suture repair enhanced the structural properties of the ACL, and the improvement was associated with increased cellularity within the healing ligament.
Clinical Relevance The addition of a bioactive scaffold to the wound site improved the functional healing of the ACL after suture repair. The decreased repair strength during revascularization may indicate a need to protect the repair site through this period.},

	abstract = {The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fails to heal after suture repair. One hypothesis for this failure is the premature loss of the fibrin clot, or provisional scaffolding, between the two ligament ends in the joint environment. To test this hypothesis, a substitute provisional scaffold of collagen–platelet rich plasma (PRP) hydrogel was used to fill the ACL wound site at the time of suture repair and the structural properties of the healing ACLs evaluated 4 weeks after surgery. Bilateral ACL transections were performed in five 30-kg Yorkshire pigs and treated with suture repair. In each animal, one of the repairs was augmented with placement of a collagen–PRP hydrogel at the ACL transection site, while the contralateral knee had suture repair alone. In addition, six control knees with intact ACLs from three additional animals were used as a control group. No postoperative immobilization was used. After 4 weeks the animals underwent in vivo magnetic resonance imaging to assess the size of the healing ACL, followed by biomechanical testing to determine tensile properties. The supplementation of suture repair with a collagen–PRP hydrogel resulted in significant improvements in load at yield, maximum load, and linear stiffness at 4 weeks. We conclude that use of a stabilized provisional scaffold, such as a collagen–PRP hydrogel, to supplement primary repair of the ACL can result in improved biomechanical properties at an early time point. Further studies to determine the long-term effect of primary repair enhancement are needed. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 25:81–91, 2007},

	abstract = {Abstract Fibrin glue has been widely used in a variety of surgical procedures to promote haemostasis and tissue bonding. It can also be used as a cell carrier for stem cells on tendons. However, the data about the effect of fibrin glue on flexor tendon healing is very limited. The present study examined the role of fibrin glue TISSEEL® in a rabbit model of flexor tendon injury. The rabbits were killed 3 or 8 weeks after the operation. The range-of-motion of the fingers and biomechanical properties of tendons were measured and compared between the control group and TISSEEL-treated group. The findings have shown that the range-of-motion in the TISSEEL-treated group was significantly different from that of the control group at 3 weeks after the operation. However, there is no significant difference in range-of-motion at 8 weeks after the operation. Moreover, there is no significant difference in biomechanical properties between the control group and TISSEEL-treated group. The results indicate that TISSEEL may attenuate adhesion formation at the early stage of flexor tendon repair. However, there is no significant effect on biomechanical features during tendon repair. In conclusion, this study has shown that it may be safe to use TISSEEL in tissue engineering applications for tendon regeneration and healing.},

Understanding the limitations of surgical techniques to place tunnels is important. Once grafts are placed, new biologic strategies to promote intra-articular and intraosseous healing are evolving.

Silks can be chemically modified through amino acid side chains to alter surface properties or to immobilize cellular growth factors. Molecular engineering of silk sequences has been used to modify silks with specific features, such as cell recognition or mineralization. The degradability of silk biomaterials can be related to the mode of processing and the corresponding content of β-sheet crystallinity. Several primary cells and cell lines have been successfully grown on different silk biomaterials to demonstrate a range of biological outcomes.

	abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are currently treated by removing the injured ligament and replacing it with a tendon graft. Recent studies have examined alternative treatment methods, including repair and regeneration of the injured ligament. In order to make such an approach feasible, a basic understanding of ACL biology and its response to injury is needed. Identification of obstacles to native ACL healing can then be identified and potentially resolved using tissue engineering strategies—first, with in vitro screening assays, and then with in vivo models of efficacy and safety. This Perspectives paper outlines this path of discovery for optimizing ACL healing using a bio-enhanced repair technique. This journey required constructing indices of the functional tissue response, pioneering physiologically based methods of biomechanical testing, developing, and validating clinically relevant animal models, and creating and optimizing translationally feasible scaffolds, surgical techniques, and biologic additives. Using this systematic translational approach, “bio-enhanced” ACL repair has been advanced to the point where it may become an option for future treatment of acute ACL injuries and the prevention of subsequent post-traumatic osteoarthritis associated with this injury. © 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The quantitative results were based on epithelial growth curves, the morphological picture was based on the findings in epithelium, and the aging of a biomaterial was simulated. Epithelium morphology was investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis. Quantitative results showed that on Dow Corning Elastomer and polypropylene oxide, cell proliferation was significantly lower compared to normal growth curves. The morphological findings were negative for polypropylene oxide, and did not discriminate between the other biomaterials under study. The simulation results indicated better biocompatibility for the polyurethanes and the polyether polyester copolymer compared with that of polypropylene oxide and both silicone rubbers. Under the simulation conditions, cells exposed to Silastic showed siliconcontaining inclusions.

Here, we report the synthesis of several new poly(ethylene glycol) grafted branched polymers for functionalization of various nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles (NPs), and gold nanorods (NRs), affording high aqueous solubility and stability for these materials. We synthesize different surfactant polymers based upon poly(?-glutamic acid) (?PGA) and poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMHC18). We use the abundant free carboxylic acid groups of ?PGA for attaching lipophilic species such as pyrene or phospholipid, which bind to nanomaterials via robust physisorption. Additionally, the remaining carboxylic acids on ?PGA or the amine-reactive anhydrides of PMHC18 are then PEGylated, providing extended hydrophilic groups, affording polymeric amphiphiles. We show that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), Au NPs, and NRs functionalized by the polymers exhibit high stability in aqueous solutions at different pH values, at elevated temperatures, and in serum. Morever, the polymer-coated SWNTs exhibit remarkably long blood circulation (t1/2 = 22.1 h) upon intravenous injection into mice, far exceeding the previous record of 5.4 h. The ultralong blood circulation time suggests greatly delayed clearance of nanomaterials by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of mice, a highly desired property for in vivo applications of nanomaterials, including imaging and drug delivery.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease represents one of the major health challenges in modern times and is the number one cause of death globally. Thus, numerous studies are under way to identify effective cell- and/or growth factor (GF)-based therapies for repairing damaged cardiac tissue. In this regard, improving the engraftment or survival of regenerative cells and prolonging GF exposure have become fundamental goals in advancing these therapeutic approaches. Biomaterials have emerged as innovative scaffolds for the delivery of both cells and proteins in tissue engineering applications. In the present study, electrospinning was used to generate smooth homogenous polymeric fibers, which consisted of a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) polymer blend encapsulating the cardioactive GF, Neuregulin-1 (Nrg). We evaluated the biocompatibility and degradation of this Nrg-containing biomaterial in a rat model of myocardial ischemia. Histological analysis revealed the presence of an initial acute inflammatory response after implantation, which was followed by a chronic inflammatory phase, characterized by the presence of giant cells. Notably, the scaffold remained in the heart after 3 months. Furthermore, an increase in the M2:M1 macrophage ratio following implantation suggested the induction of constructive tissue remodeling. Taken together, the combination of Nrg-encapsulating scaffolds with cells capable of inducing cardiac regeneration could represent an ambitious and promising therapeutic strategy for repairing diseased or damaged myocardial tissue.},

Herein, we report on the use of maleimide-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as cocross-linkers for the preparation of a bionanocomposite gelatin based hydrogel. Diels?Alder cycloaddition of benzotriazole maleimide (BTM) functionalized Ag NPs and furan containing gelatin in combination with additional amide coupling resulted in stable and biocompatible hybrid nanocomposite. The storage moduli values for the hydrogel are nearly three times higher than that of control hydrogel without NPs indicating a stabilizing role of the covalently bound NPs. Finally, the swelling and drug release properties of the materials as well as the biocompatibility and toxicity tests indicate the biomedical potential of this type of material.},

The hydrogel precursors cross-linked to form a flexible hydrogel upon mixing. The hydrogel was biodegradable and provided a durable physical barrier, which was highly effective in reducing the formation of post-operative adhesions. Ten out of 12 animals in the untreated control group developed fibrous adhesions requiring sharp dissection, while only 2 out of 8 animals treated with HAX gels showed such adhesions, and those occurred in locations that were not covered by the hydrogel. We also studied means by which gel degradation time can be modulated by varying the precursor concentration and molecular weight.},

	abstract = {Porous PLGA/PVA scaffolds as hydrophilized PLGA scaffolds for tissue engineering applications were fabricated by a novel melt-molding particulate leaching method (non-solvent method). The prepared scaffolds exhibited highly porous and open-cellular pore structures with almost same surface and interior porosities (pore size, 200–300 μ m; porosity, about 90\%). The in vitro degradation behavior of the PLGA and PLGA/PVA scaffolds was compared at 37∘C in PBS (pH 7.4) with and without the solution change everyday to see the effect of solution pH as well as scaffold hydrophilicity on the degradation behavior. The changes in dimension, molecular weight, mechanical properties (maximum load and modulus), and morphology of the scaffolds were examined with degradation time. The degradation behavior of the PLGA and PLGA/PVA scaffolds was further investigated in vivousing a rat model (subcutaneously implantation). It was observed that both PLGA and PLGA/PVA scaffolds in decreasing pH condition (PBS no change) showed faster degradation than those in constant pH condition (PBS change everyday), owing to the enhanced intramolecular depolymerization by the increment of chain hydrophilicity caused by carboxylate groups as well as the autocatalysis of carboxylic acids accumulated in the solution by the cleavage of PLGA backbone ester bonds. The scaffolds in vivo condition also showed faster degradation than those in vitro, probably due to the aid of foreign body giant cells or enzymes. The PLGA/PVA scaffold showed slightly faster degradation than the PLGA scaffold for both in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

Since the first resilin sequence was identified in Drosophilia melanogaster (fruit fly), researchers have utilized molecular cloning techniques to construct resilin-based proteins for a number of different applications. In addition to exhibiting the superior mechanical properties of resilin, resilin-based proteins are autofluorescent, display self-assembly properties, and undergo phase transitions in response to temperature. These properties have potential application in designing biosensors or environmentally responsive materials for use in tissue engineering or drug delivery. Furthermore, the capability of resilin-based biomaterials has been expanded by designing proteins that include both resilin-based sequences and bioactive domains such as cell-adhesion or matrix metalloproteinase sequences. These new materials maintain the superior mechanical and physical properties of resilin and also have the added benefit of controlling cell response. Because the mechanical and biological properties can be tuned through protein engineering, a wide range of properties can be achieved for tissue engineering applications including muscles, vocal folds, cardiovascular tissues, and cartilage.},

Resilin is an attractive candidate for use in modular proteins because it is well-known for having low stiffness, high fatigue lifetime, and high resilience. However, no studies have been conducted to assess resilin?s compressive properties, cytocompatibility with clinically relevant cells, or effect on cell spreading. We designed a modular protein containing repeating sequences of a motif derived from Anopheles gambiae and cell-binding domains derived from fibronectin. Rapid cross-linking with tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine was observed. The hydrogels had a complex modulus of 22 ± 1 kPa and yield strain of 63\%. The elastic modulus in compression, or unconfined compressive modulus, was 2.4 ± 0.2 MPa, which is on the same order as human cartilage. A LIVE/DEAD assay demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells cultured on the resilin-based protein had a viability of 95\% after three days. A cell-spreading assay revealed that the cells interacted with the fibronectin-derived domain in a sequence-specific manner and resulted in a mean cell area ?1.4-fold larger than when cells were seeded on a sequence-scrambled negative control protein. These results demonstrate that our resilin-based biomaterial is a promising biomaterial for cartilage tissue engineering.},

The structural basis of these hydrogels is discussed with reference to the specific chemical interactions, which dictate gel formation. The synthesis and chemistry of these hydrogels is discussed using specific pharmaceutical examples. Covalent crosslinking leads to formation of hydrogels with a permanent network structure, since irreversible chemical links are formed. This type of linkage allows absorption of water and/or bioactive compounds without dissolution and permits drug release by diffusion. pH-controlled drug delivery is made possible by the addition of another polymer. Ionically crosslinked hydrogels are generally considered as biocompatible and well-tolerated. Their non-permanent network is formed by reversible links. Ionically crosslinked chitosan hydrogels exhibit a higher swelling sensitivity to pH changes compared to covalently crosslinked chitosan hydrogels. This extends their potential application, since dissolution can occur in extreme acidic or basic pH conditions.},

	abstract = {Our aim was to develop a biodegradable fibrous dressing to act as a tissue guide for in situ wound repair while releasing Ibuprofen to reduce inflammation in wounds and reduce pain for patients on dressing changes. Dissolving the acid form of Ibuprofen (from 1\% to 10\% by weight) in the same solvent as 75\% polylactide, 25\% polyglycolide (PLGA) polymers gave uniformly loaded electrospun fibers which gave rapid release of drug within the first 8 h and then slower release over several days. Scaffolds with 10\% Ibuprofen degraded within 6 days. The Ibuprofen released from these scaffolds significantly reduced the response of fibroblasts to major pro-inflammatory stimulators. Fibroblast attachment and proliferation on scaffolds was unaffected by the addition of 1–5\% Ibuprofen. Scaffolds loaded with 10\% Ibuprofen initially showed reduced cell attachment but this was restored by soaking scaffolds in media for 24 h. In summary, addition of Ibuprofen to electrospun biodegradable scaffolds can give acute protection of adjacent cells to inflammation while the scaffolds provide an open 3D fibrous network to which cells can attach and migrate. By 6 days, such scaffolds will have completely dissolved into the wound bed obviating any need for dressing removal. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2010; 105: 396–408. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Biodegradable nanofibers have become a popular candidate for tissue engineering scaffolds because of their biomimetic structure that physically resembles the extracellular matrix. For certain tissue regeneration applications, prolonged in vitro culture time for cellular reorganization and tissue remodeling may be required. Therefore, extensive understanding of cellular effects on scaffold degradation is needed. There are only few studies on the degradation of nanofibers, and also the studies on degradation throughout cell culture are rare. In this study, polyglycolide (PGA), poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactide-co-ɛ-caprolactone) [P(LLA-CL)] were electrospun into nanofibrous meshes. The nanofibers were cultured with porcine smooth muscle cells for up to 3 months to evaluate their degradation behavior and cellular response. The results showed that the degradation rates are in the order of PGA {\textgreater}{\textgreater} PLGA {\textgreater} P(LLA-CL). PGA nanofibers degraded in 3 weeks and supported cell growth only in the first few days. PLGA nanofiber scaffolds facilitated cell growth during the first 30 days after seeding, but cell growth was slow thereafter. P(LLA-CL) nanofibers facilitated long-term (1–3 months) cell growth. mRNA quantification using real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that some smooth muscle cell markers (α-actinin and calponin) and extracellular matrix genes (collagen and integrin) seemed to be downregulated with increased cell culture time. Cell culture significantly increased the degradation rate of PGA nanofibers, whereas the effect on PLGA and P(LLA-CL) nanofibers was limited. We found that the molecular weight of P(LLA-CL) and PLGA nanofibers decreased linearly for up to 100 days. Half lives of PLGA and P(LLA-CL) nanofibers were shown to be 80 and 110 days, respectively. In summary, this is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate long-term polymeric nanofiber degradation in vitro with cell culture. Cell culture accelerated the nanofibrous scaffold degradation to a limited extent. P(LLA-CL) nanofibers could be a good choice as scaffolds for long-term smooth muscle cell culture.},

In the present study we set out to evaluate the addition of thrombin-derived host defense peptides to human acellular dermis (hAD, i.e. epiflex®). Antimicrobial activity of the functionalized hAD was demonstrated using radial diffusion and viable count assays against Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Electron microscopy analyses showed that peptide-mediated bacterial killing led to reduced hAD degradation. Furthermore, peptide-functionalized hAD displayed endotoxin-binding activity in vitro, as evidenced by inhibition of NF-κB activation in human monocytic cells (THP-1 cells) and a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in whole blood in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The dermal substitute retained its anti-endotoxic activity after washing, compatible with results showing that the hAD bound a significant amount of peptide. Furthermore, bacteria-induced contact activation was inhibited by peptide addition to the hAD. E. coli infected hAD, alone, or after treatment with the antiseptic substance polyhexamethylenebiguanide (PHMB), yielded NF-κB activation in THP-1 cells. The activation was abrogated by peptide addition. Thus, thrombin-derived HDPs should be of interest in the further development of new biomaterials with combined antimicrobial and anti-endotoxic functions for use in surgery and wound treatment.},

	abstract = {There is a need for better wound dressings that possess the requisite angiogenic capacity for rapid in situ healing of full-thickness skin wounds. Borate bioactive glass microfibers are showing a remarkable ability to heal soft tissue wounds but little is known about the process and mechanisms of healing. In the present study, wound dressings composed of borate bioactive glass microfibers (diameter = 0.4–1.2 μm; composition 6Na2O, 8K2O, 8MgO, 22CaO, 54B2O3, 2P2O5; mol\%) doped with 0–3.0 wt.\% CuO were created and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. When immersed in simulated body fluid, the fibers degraded and converted to hydroxyapatite within ∼7 days, releasing ions such as Ca, B and Cu into the medium. In vitro cell culture showed that the ionic dissolution product of the fibers was not toxic to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts, promoted HUVEC migration, tubule formation and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and stimulated the expression of angiogenic-related genes of the fibroblasts. When used to treat full-thickness skin defects in rodents, the Cu-doped fibers (3.0 wt.\% CuO) showed a significantly better capacity to stimulate angiogenesis than the undoped fibers and the untreated defects (control) at 7 and 14 days post-surgery. The defects treated with the Cu-doped and undoped fibers showed improved collagen deposition, maturity and orientation when compared to the untreated defects, the improvement shown by the Cu-doped fibers was not markedly better than the undoped fibers at 14 days post-surgery. These results indicate that the Cu-doped borate glass microfibers have a promising capacity to stimulate angiogenesis and heal full-thickness skin defects. They also provide valuable data for understanding the role of the microfibers in healing soft tissue wounds.},

FE-SEM images indicate that the average fiber diameter increased from 392 to 541 nm when the coating bilayers varied from 5 to 20.5. Besides, the excellent biocompatibility and enhanced attachment and spreading of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) of prepared nanofibrous mats are confirmed by MTT and SEM results. Furthermore, the LBL structured (CS/collagen)n nanofibrous mats greatly improve the cell migration in vitro, promote re-epithelialization and vascularization in vivo, and up-regulate the expression of collagen Ⅳ and α-tubulin, as well as the Integrin β1 and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr-397. The levels of expressed protein are significantly enhanced with increasing coating bilayers via immunohistochemistry and western blotting analyses. Collectively, these results suggest that the LBL structured biomimetic nanofibrous matrices may enhance cell migration and further promote the skin regeneration by up-regulating the secretion of ECM protein and triggering Integrin/FAK signaling pathway, which demonstrate the potential use of the nanofibrous mats to rapidly restore the structural and functional properties of wounded skin.},

Enzyme immobilization provides an excellent base for increasing availability of enzyme to the substrate with greater turnover over a considerable period of time. Several natural and synthetic supports have been assessed for their efficiency for enzyme immobilization. Nowadays, immobilized enzymes are preferred over their free counterpart due to their prolonged availability that curtails redundant downstream and purification processes. Future investigations should endeavor at adopting logistic and sensible entrapment techniques along with innovatively modified supports to improve the state of enzyme immobilization and provide new perspectives to the industrial sector.},

	abstract = {Alginate–chitosan core-shell microcapsules were prepared in order to develop a biocompatible matrix for enzyme immobilization, where the protein is retained either in a liquid or solid core and the shell allows permeability control over substrates and products. The permeability coefficients of different molecular weight compounds (vitamin B2, vitamin B12, and myoglobin) were determined through sodium tripolyphosphate (Na-TPP)-crosslinked chitosan membrane. The microcapsule core was formed by crosslinking sodium alginate with either calcium or barium ions. The crosslinked alginate core was uniformly coated with a chitosan layer and crosslinked with Na-TPP. In the case of calcium alginate, the phosphate ions of Na-TPP were able to extract the calcium ions from alginate and liquefy the core. A model enzyme, β-galactosidase, was immobilized in the alginate core and the catalytic activity was measured with o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG). Change in the activity of free and immobilized enzyme was determined at three different temperatures. Na-TPP crosslinked chitosan membranes were found to be permeable to solutes of up to 17,000 Da molecular weight. The enzyme loading efficiency was higher in the barium alginate core (100\%) as compared to the calcium alginate core (60\%). The rate of ONPG conversion to o-nitrophenol was faster in the case of calcium alginate–chitosan microcapsules as compared to barium alginate–chitosan microcapsules. Barium alginate–chitosan microcapsules, however, did improve the stability of the enzyme at 37°C relative to calcium alginate–chitosan microcapsules or free enzyme. This study illustrates a new method of enzyme immobilization for biotechnology applications using liquid or solid core and shell microcapsule technology.},

For all lecithin/chitosan NPs, no notable differences in the mean particle size, size distribution, zeta potential or melatonin content were observed before or immediately after the lyophilisation process or after 7 months of storage at 4°C. The residual moisture contents of lyophilisates with glucose and trehalose immediately after the lyophilisation process varied between 4.0—4.8\% and 2.4—3.0\%, respectively. All lecithin/chitosan NPs had a fully amorphous nature after the freeze-drying process, as indicated by modulated differential scanning calorimetry. NP lyophilisates with glucose had a low glass transition temperature (ca. 5°C), confirming that lyophilisation with glucose as a cryoprotectant was not appropriate. All lyophilisates with trehalose had a glass transition temperature above the room temperature, allowing formation of the cake without a collapse of the structure, which was capable of preserving its characteristics and appearance following 7 months of storage at 4°C.},

Wafers were prepared by lyophilising aqueous gels of the polymer incorporating varying concentrations of glycerol as plasticizer and d-mannitol as cryoprotectant. The different formulations were characterised by their physico-mechanical properties in order to select the optimum system for further development. The optimised formulation with 6.5 mg each of both plasticizer and cryoprotectant was loaded with bovine serum albumin and lyophilised with or without annealing. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the appropriate lyophilisation cycle by evaluating thermal events before lyophilisation and possible phase separation of bovine serum albumin after lyophilisation. Texture analysis was employed to investigate the in vitro mucoadhesive properties in tensile mode, residual moisture content by thermo-gravimetric analysis while hydration capacity and drug release studies were performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline. Microscopic architecture and crystallinity were examined using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry respectively. The ease of hydration, in vitro mucoadhesive characteristics, microscopic architecture and BSA release were influenced by the annealing process. A 7 h cumulative percentage drug release of 91.5\% and 80.1\% was observed for the annealed and non-annealed wafers respectively. The results showed the potential of employing lyophilised chitosan wafers for buccal mucosa delivery of protein based drugs.},

	abstract = {A novel lab-on-paper device combining the simplicity and low-cost of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and the sensitivity and selectivity of chemiluminescence ELISA (CL-ELISA) for the high-throughput, rapid, stable and reusable point-of-care testing is presented here. Chitosan was used to modify μPADs to covalently immobilize antibodies on μPADs. Thus, sandwich CL-ELISA on μPADs can be easily realized for further development of this technique in sensitive, specific and low-cost application. The paper device was fabricated by a low-cost, simple, and rapid wax-screen-printing method. Using tumor markers and paper microzone plate as model, the application test of this paper-based CL-ELISA was successfully performed with a linear range of 0.1–35.0 ng mL−1 for α-fetoprotein, 0.5–80.0 U mL−1 for cancer antigen 125 and 0.1–70.0 ng mL−1 for carcinoembryonic antigen. Since the cutoff values of the three tumor markers in clinical diagnosis are 25 ng mL−1, 35 U mL−1 and 5 ng mL−1, the sensitivity and linear ranges of the proposed method were enough for clinical application. In addition, this lab-on-paper immunodevice can provide reproducible results upon storage at 4 °C (sealed) for at least 5 weeks. Ultimately, this novel chitosan modification and wax-screen-printing methodology for μPADs can be readily translated to other signal reporting mechanism including electrochemiluminescence and photoelectrochemistry, and other receptors such as enzyme receptors and DNA receptors for determination of DNA, proteins and small molecules in point-of-care testing.},

Here we present nanomaterial designs and integration strategies for the bioresorbable electronic stent with drug-infused functionalized nanoparticles to enable flow sensing, temperature monitoring, data storage, wireless power/data transmission, inflammation suppression, localized drug delivery, and hyperthermia therapy.

	abstract = {Poly(lactic acid) PLA was plasticized with low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) PEG-200 to improve the ductility of PLA, while maintaining the plasticizer content at maximum 10 wt\%. Low molecular weight of PEG enables increased miscibility with PLA and more efficient reduction of glass transition temperature (Tg). This effect is enhanced not only by the low molecular weight but also by its higher content. The tensile properties demonstrated that the addition of PEG-200 to PLA led to an increase of elongation at break ({\textgreater}7000\%), but a decrease of both tensile strength and tensile modulus. The plasticization of the PLA with PEG-200 effectively lowers Tg as well as cold-crystallization temperature, increasing with plasticizer content. SEM micrographs reveal plastic deformation and few long threads of a deformed material are discernible on the fracture surface. The use of low molecular weight PEG-200 reduces the intermolecular force and increases the mobility of the polymeric chains, thereby improving the flexibility and plastic deformation of PLA. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For a wound to heal successfully, all four phases must occur in the proper sequence and time frame. Many factors can interfere with one or more phases of this process, thus causing improper or impaired wound healing. This article reviews the recent literature on the most significant factors that affect cutaneous wound healing and the potential cellular and/or molecular mechanisms involved. The factors discussed include oxygenation, infection, age and sex hormones, stress, diabetes, obesity, medications, alcoholism, smoking, and nutrition. A better understanding of the influence of these factors on repair may lead to therapeutics that improve wound healing and resolve impaired wounds.},

The effects of TPU properties and HA particle size on scaffold physical properties and osteoblast-like cell performance were investigated. It was found that the addition of micro-HA (mHA), which was inlayed in the fiber, decreased the electrospun fiber diameter. On the contrary, nano-HA (nHA), which was either embedded or existed inside of the fiber, increased the fiber diameter for both soft and hard TPUs. The soft TPU had a much lower Young's modulus and higher strain-at-break than the hard TPU. The addition of both mHA and nHA decreased the tensile properties; this decrease was more significant with mHA. The cells on the hard scaffolds actively proliferated and migrated compared to those on the soft scaffolds. On the other hand, cells on the soft scaffolds more effectively induced osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) than those on the hard scaffolds. In addition, our data suggest that the soft scaffolds with supplementation of nHA further enhanced osteogenesis of hMSCs compared to those without nHA. The soft TPU scaffolds containing nano-HA have the potential to be used in bone tissue engineering applications.},

The RGD sequence is the cell attachment site of a large number of adhesive extracellular matrix, blood, and cell surface proteins, and nearly half of the over 20 known integrins recognize this sequence in their adhesion protein ligands. Some other integrins bind to related sequences in their ligands. The integrin-binding activity of adhesion proteins can be reproduced by short synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence. Such peptides promote cell adhesion when insolubilized onto a surface, and inhibit it when presented to cells in solution. Reagents that bind selectively to only one or a few of the RGD-directed integrins can be designed by cyclizing peptides with selected sequences around the RGD and by synthesizing RGD mimics. As the integrin-mediated cell attachment influences and regulates cell migration, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, the RGD peptides and mimics can be used to probe integrin functions in various biological systems. Drug design based on the RGD structure may provide new treatments for diseases such as thrombosis, osteoporosis, and cancer.},

The crystal structure of the major pilin of S. pyogenes, Spy0128, revealed that each domain of the two domain protein contained an intramolecular isopeptide bond cross-link joining a Lys side chain to an Asn side chain. In the present work, mutagenesis was used to create mutant proteins that lacked either one isopeptide bond (E117A, N168A, and E258A mutants) or both isopeptide bonds (E117A/E258A). Both the thermal stability and proteolytic stability of Spy0128 were severely compromised by loss of the isopeptide bonds. Unfolding experiments, monitored by circular dichroism, revealed a transition temperature Tm of 85 °C for the wild type protein. In contrast, mutants with only one isopeptide bond showed biphasic unfolding, with the domain lacking an isopeptide bond having a Tm that was ∼30 °C lower than the unaltered domain. High resolution crystal structures of the E117A and N168A mutants showed that the loss of an isopeptide bond did not change the overall pilin structure but caused local disturbance of the protein core that was greater for E117A than for N168A. These effects on stability appear also to be important for pilus assembly.},

Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have multiple Fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein. The bacterium-binding site in the amino-terminal domain (1–5F1) of Fn contains five sequential Fn type 1 (F1) modules. Here we show the structure of a streptococcal (S. dysgalactiae) FnBP peptide (B3) in complex with the module pair 1F12F1. This identifies 1F1- and 2F1-binding motifs in B3 that form additional antiparallel β-strands on sequential F1 modules—the first example of a tandem β-zipper. Sequence analyses of larger regions of FnBPs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus reveal a repeating pattern of F1-binding motifs that match the pattern of F1 modules in 1–5F1 of Fn. In the process of Fn-mediated invasion of host cells, therefore, the bacterial proteins seem to exploit the modular structure of Fn by forming extended tandem β-zippers. This work is a vital step forward in explaining the full mechanism of the integrin-dependent FnBP-mediated invasion of host cells.},

	abstract = {The ability to modulate the surface chemical characteristics of solid-state nanopores is of great interest as it provides the means to control the macroscopic response of nanofluidic devices. For instance, controlling surface charge and polarity of the pore walls is one of the most important applications of surface modification that is very relevant to attain accurate control over the transport of ions through the nanofluidic architecture. In this work, we describe a new integrative chemical approach to fabricate nanofluidic diodes based on the self-polymerization of dopamine (PDOPA) on asymmetric track-etched nanopores. Our results demonstrate that PDOPA coating is not only a simple and effective method to modify the inner surface of polymer nanopores fully compatible with the fabrication of nanofluidic devices but also a versatile platform for further integration of more complex molecules through different covalent chemistries and self-assembly processes. We adjusted the chemical modification strategy to obtain various configurations of the pore surface: (i) PDOPA layer was used as primer, precursor, or even responsive functional coating; (ii) PDOPA layer was used as a platform for anchoring chemical functions via the Michael addition reaction; and (iii) PDOPA was used as a reactive layer inducing the metallization of the pore walls through the in situ reduction of metallic precursors present in solution. We believe that the transversal concept of integrative surface chemistry offered by polydopamine in combination with the remarkable physical characteristics of asymmetric nanopores constitutes a new framework to design multifunctional nanofluidic devices employing soft chemistry-based nanofunctionalization techniques.},

	abstract = {A novel bioinspired strategy for protein nanoparticle (NP) synthesis to achieve pH-responsive drug release exploits the pH-dependent changes in the coordination stoichiometry of iron(III)–3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) complexes, which play a major cross-linking role in mussel byssal threads. Doxorubicin-loaded polymeric NPs that are based on FeIII–DOPA complexation were thus synthesized with a DOPA-modified recombinant mussel adhesive protein through a co-electrospraying process. The release of doxorubicin was found to be predominantly governed by a change in the structure of the FeIII–DOPA complexes induced by an acidic pH value. It was also demonstrated that the fabricated NPs exhibited effective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells through efficient cellular uptake and cytosolic release. Therefore, it is anticipated that FeIII–DOPA complexation can be successfully utilized as a new design principle for pH-responsive NPs for diverse controlled drug-delivery applications.},

	abstract = {Lung fibroblast functions such as matrix remodeling and activation of latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) are associated with expression of the myofibroblast phenotype and are directly linked to fibroblast capacity to generate force and deform the extracellular matrix. However, the study of fibroblast force-generating capacities through methods such as traction force microscopy is hindered by low throughput and time-consuming procedures. In this study, we improved at the detail level methods for higher-throughput traction measurements on polyacrylamide hydrogels using gel-surface-bound fluorescent beads to permit autofocusing and automated displacement mapping, and transduction of fibroblasts with a fluorescent label to streamline cell boundary identification. Together these advances substantially improve the throughput of traction microscopy and allow us to efficiently compute the forces exerted by lung fibroblasts on substrates spanning the stiffness range present in normal and fibrotic lung tissue. Our results reveal that lung fibroblasts dramatically alter the forces they transmit to the extracellular matrix as its stiffness changes, with very low forces generated on matrices as compliant as normal lung tissue. Moreover, exogenous TGF-β1 selectively accentuates tractions on stiff matrices, mimicking fibrotic lung, but not on physiological stiffness matrices, despite equivalent changes in Smad2/3 activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a pivotal role for matrix mechanical properties in regulating baseline and TGF-β1-stimulated contraction of lung fibroblasts and suggest that stiff fibrotic lung tissue may promote myofibroblast activation through contractility-driven events, whereas normal lung tissue compliance may protect against such feedback amplification of fibroblast activation.},

	abstract = {Research discoveries in the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine are beginning to advance and refine our understanding of lung injury and repair. Although these emerging studies offer unprecedented opportunities to develop novel therapies for a variety of lung diseases, the quickening pace of work in this nascent field also makes it difficult to discern hope from hype when addressing the pleas of patients eager for clinical translation or when seeking information on the risk versus reward of participation in clinical trials. This perspective provides an overview of the latest advances in lung-related stem cell research and places the new discoveries in a historical context. Established, lineage-restricted epithelial progenitors of the conducting airways and gas-exchanging alveoli are briefly reviewed, and controversial, newly proposed tissue-specific candidate lung stem/progenitor cells with broader differentiation repertoire are introduced. Exogenous derivation of lung epithelia from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells is also presented as an alternative method for engineering lung tissue de novo in culture.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, debilitating, and fatal lung disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The prognosis for patients with IPF is poor and the quest to find effective therapies has been unsuccessful. Despite several clinical trials over the past decade, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for patients with IPF and thus no standard of care. In terms of pathogenesis, IPF is characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and loss of lung function. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a therapy for the treatment of IPF. MSCs have potential as a novel therapeutic agent in multiple diseases and they have been safely administered in a number of clinical trials. Some, but not all, preclinical studies in animal models of lung fibrosis suggest that MSCs might be effective in the treatment of IPF. Given the safety and ease of MSC administration in other patient populations, the results in preclinical animal models of IPF, and the major need for novel therapeutic options in this devastating disease, we propose that carefully designed clinical trials of MSCs for the treatment of patients with IPF are appropriate. Establishing safety in the setting of IPF is the first priority in early clinical trials followed by clinical and biological measures of efficacy.},

	abstract = {Unregulated activity of myofibroblasts, highly contractile cells that deposit abundant extracellular matrix (ECM), leads to fibrosis. To study the modulation of myofibroblast activity, we used human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), which have much potential in regenerative medicine. We found that ADSCs treated with TGF-β developed a myofibroblastic phenotype with increases in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a myofibroblast marker, and ECM proteins type I collagen and fibronectin. In contrast, treatment with bFGF had the opposite effect. bFGF-differentiated ADSCs showed marked down-regulation of α-SMA expression, collagen I, and fibronectin, and loss of focal adhesions and stress fibers. Functionally, bFGF-differentiated ADSCs were significantly more migratory, which correlated with up-regulation of tenascin-C, an anti-adhesive ECM protein, and vimentin, a pro-migratory cytoskeletal protein. On the other hand, TGF-β-differentiated ADSCs were significantly more contractile than bFGF-differentiated cells. Interestingly, cells completely reversed their morphologies, marker expression, signaling pathways, and contractility versus migratory profiles when switched from culture with one growth factor to the other, demonstrating that the myofibroblast differentiation process is not terminal. Cell differentiation was associated with activation of Smad2 downstream of TGF-β and of ERK/MAP kinase downstream of bFGF. Reversibility of the TGF-β-induced myofibroblastic phenotype depends, in part, on bFGF-induced ERK/MAP kinase signaling. These findings show that ADSC differentiation into myofibroblasts and re-differentiation into fibroblast-like cells can be manipulated with growth factors, which may have implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is initiated by defective host defense that predisposes airways to bacterial infection. Advanced CF is characterized by a deficit in mucociliary transport (MCT), a process that traps and propels bacteria out of the lungs, but whether this deficit occurs first or is secondary to airway remodeling has been unclear. To assess MCT, we tracked movement of radiodense microdisks in airways of newborn piglets with CF. Cholinergic stimulation, which elicits mucus secretion, substantially reduced microdisk movement. Impaired MCT was not due to periciliary liquid depletion; rather, CF submucosal glands secreted mucus strands that remained tethered to gland ducts. Inhibiting anion secretion in non-CF airways replicated CF abnormalities. Thus, impaired MCT is a primary defect in CF, suggesting that submucosal glands and tethered mucus may be targets for early CF treatment.
A breathtaking tale of sticky mucus
Patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulty breathing because their airways are clogged with thick mucus. Does this mucus accumulate because there is a defect in the way it is produced? Or does it accumulate because of other disease features, such as dehydration or airway wall remodeling? Distinguishing between these possibilities is important for future drug development. In a study of piglets with cystic fibrosis, Hoegger et al. identify mucus production as the primary defect (see the Perspective by Wine). The airway glands of the piglets synthesized strands of mucus normally, but the strands were never released and stayed tethered to the gland ducts.

In conventional, covalently crosslinked hydrogels, degradation is typically required to allow complex cellular functions to occur, leading to bulk material degradation. In contrast, adaptable hydrogels are formed by reversible crosslinks. Through breaking and re-formation of the reversible linkages, adaptable hydrogels can be locally modified to permit complex cellular functions while maintaining their long-term integrity. In addition, these adaptable materials can have biomimetic viscoelastic properties that make them well suited for several biotechnology and medical applications. In this review, an overview of adaptable-hydrogel design considerations and linkage selections is presented, with a focus on various cell-compatible crosslinking mechanisms that can be exploited to form adaptable hydrogels for tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {Background  The usefulness of bone marrow cells in accelerating wound healing has not been evaluated despite increasing evidence that bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells that have multipotentiality to differentiate into various types of cells after they enter the microenvironment of a specific tissue (niche). Objectives  To determine the effects of bone marrow cells and occlusive dressings in promoting wound healing in rats. Methods  We investigated by grafting, biopsy and immunohistochemistry whether various types of cells derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic rats would differentiate into wound component cells when administered topically on the wounds of rats. We also investigated whether topical application of bone marrow cells with an occlusive dressing would accelerate the healing of wounds with exposed bones, as measured by planimetry. Results  GFP-labelled bone marrow cells contained multipotent stem cells that sufficiently differentiated into wound myofibroblasts presenting with α-smooth muscle actin in granulation tissue. Other types of cells, including myocytes, adipocytes, peripheral blood cells from buffy coat and dermal fibroblasts, did not express myofibroblast characteristics morphologically or immunohistochemically. Application of bone marrow cells and an occlusive dressing accelerated the repair of wounds with exposed bones, compared with an occlusive dressing only or with the topical administration of bone marrow cells plus a semidry to dry dressing. Conclusions  Our study indicates that bone marrow cells accelerate the healing of wounds at least in part through their differentiation into wound myofibroblasts. Thus, treatment of wounds with bone marrow cells and a supportive occlusive dressing is effective in promoting the formation of healthy granulation tissue and also for the preparation of an ideal wound bed.},

	abstract = {Fibroblasts are the major mesenchymal cell type in connective tissue and deposit the collagen and elastic fibres of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Even within a single tissue, fibroblasts exhibit considerable functional diversity, but it is not known whether this reflects the existence of a differentiation hierarchy or is a response to different environmental factors. Here we show, using transplantation assays and lineage tracing in mice, that the fibroblasts of skin connective tissue arise from two distinct lineages. One forms the upper dermis, including the dermal papilla that regulates hair growth and the arrector pili muscle, which controls piloerection. The other forms the lower dermis, including the reticular fibroblasts that synthesize the bulk of the fibrillar ECM, and the preadipocytes and adipocytes of the hypodermis. The upper lineage is required for hair follicle formation. In wounded adult skin, the initial wave of dermal repair is mediated by the lower lineage and upper dermal fibroblasts are recruited only during re-epithelialization. Epidermal β-catenin activation stimulates the expansion of the upper dermal lineage, rendering wounds permissive for hair follicle formation. Our findings explain why wounding is linked to formation of ECM-rich scar tissue that lacks hair follicles. They also form a platform for discovering fibroblast lineages in other tissues and for examining fibroblast changes in ageing and disease.},

Myofibroblasts synthesize extracellular matrix components such as collagen types I and III and during normal wound healing disappear by apoptosis when epithelialization occurs. The transition from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is influenced by mechanical stress, TGF-β and cellular fibronectin (ED-A splice variant). These factors also play important roles in the development of fibrocontractive changes, such as those observed in liver cirrhosis, renal fibrosis, and stroma reaction to epithelial tumours.

Simple electrospinning technology served to produce nanofibrous scaffolds morphologically and structurally similar to the extracellular matrix of native tissues. The nanofibrous scaffolds of poly(l-lactic acid)-co-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLACL) and PLACL/gelatin complexes were fabricated by the electrospinning process. These nanofibres were characterized for fibre morphology, membrane porosity, wettability and chemical properties by FTIR analysis to culture human foreskin fibroblasts for skin tissue engineering. The nanofibre diameter was obtained between 282 and 761 nm for PLACL and PLACL/gelatin scaffolds; expressions of amino and carboxyl groups and porosity up to 87\% were obtained for these fibres, while they also exhibited improved hydrophilic properties after plasma treatment. The results showed that fibroblasts proliferation, morphology, CMFDA dye expression and secretion of collagen were significantly increased in plasma-treated PLACL/gelatin scaffolds compared to PLACL nanofibrous scaffolds. The obtained results prove that the plasma-treated PLACL/gelatin nanofibrous scaffold is a potential biocomposite material for skin tissue regeneration.},

This review summarizes such advances in several fields, such as the following: i) force production by the myofibroblast and mechanisms of connective tissue remodeling; ii) factors controlling the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, the most used marker of myofibroblastic phenotype and, more important, involved in force generation by the myofibroblast; and iii) factors affecting genesis of the myofibroblast and its differentiation from precursor cells, in particular epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, microRNAs, and histone modification. We also review the origin and the specific features of the myofibroblast in diverse fibrotic lesions, such as systemic sclerosis; kidney, liver, and lung fibrosis; and the stromal reaction to certain epithelial tumors. Finally, we summarize the emerging strategies for influencing myofibroblast behavior in vitro and in vivo, with the ultimate goal of an effective therapeutic approach for myofibroblast-dependent diseases.},

	abstract = {Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are active regulators of valve homeostasis and disease, responsible for secreting and remodeling the valve tissue matrix. As a result of VIC activity, the valve modulus can substantially change during development, injury and repair, and disease progression. While two-dimensional biomaterial substrates have been used to study mechanosensing and its influence on VIC phenotype, less is known about how these cells respond to matrix modulus in a three-dimensional environment. Here, we synthesized MMP-degradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with elastic moduli ranging from 0.24 kPa to 12 kPa and observed that cell morphology was constrained in stiffer gels. To vary gel stiffness without substantially changing cell morphology, cell-laden hydrogels were cultured in the 0.24 kPa gels for 3 days to allow VIC spreading, and then stiffened in situ via a second, photoinitiated thiol-ene polymerization such that the gel modulus increased from 0.24 kPa to 1.2 kPa or 13 kPa. VICs encapsulated within soft gels exhibited αSMA stress fibers (∼40\%), a hallmark of the myofibroblast phenotype. Interestingly, in stiffened gels, VICs became deactivated to a quiescent fibroblast phenotype, suggesting that matrix stiffness directs VIC phenotype independent of morphology, but in a manner that depends on the dimensionality of the culture platform. Collectively, these studies present a versatile method for dynamic stiffening of hydrogels and demonstrate the significant effects of matrix modulus on VIC myofibroblast properties in three-dimensional environments.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in nanotechnology has stimulated the development of multifunctional biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. Synergistic interactions between nanomaterials and stem cell engineering offer numerous possibilities to address some of the daunting challenges in regenerative medicine, such as controlling trigger differentiation, immune reactions, limited supply of stem cells, and engineering complex tissue structures. Specifically, the interactions between stem cells and their microenvironment play key roles in controlling stem cell fate, which underlines therapeutic success. However, the interactions between nanomaterials and stem cells are not well understood, and the effects of the nanomaterials shape, surface morphology, and chemical functionality on cellular processes need critical evaluation. In this Review, focus is put on recent development in nanomaterial–stem cell interactions, with specific emphasis on their application in regenerative medicine. Further, the emerging technologies based on nanomaterials developed over the past decade for stem cell engineering are reviewed, as well as the potential applications of these nanomaterials in tissue regeneration, stem cell isolation, and drug/gene delivery. It is anticipated that the enhanced understanding of nanomaterial–stem cell interactions will facilitate improved biomaterial design for a range of biomedical and biotechnological applications.},

	abstract = {In diabetic patients the development of chronic non-healing wounds is a common complication. A methacrylic acid-based biomaterial is a vascular regenerative material that enhances diabetic healing without the use of cells or growth factors. The bioactive nature of this material is thought to be associated with its anionic charge or surface chemistry. Contact between the methacrylic acid-based biomaterial and tissue begins with protein (including complement) adsorption and is followed by interaction of the biomaterial with resident and infiltrating cells in the wound bed (e.g., macrophages and endothelial cells). This results in changes to their surface receptors to activate phosphorylation cascades that lead to differential activation of signalling pathways such as those involving osteopontin and sonic hedgehog. These changes modulate the phenotype of the cells in the wound bed, eventually improving vessel formation and wound healing. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms will have broad implications for biomaterials, not just the methacrylic acid-based material, and will facilitate the advancement of regenerative biomaterials for diverse applications.},

	abstract = {Biophysical cues are widely recognized to influence cell phenotype. While this evidence was established using static substrates, there is growing interest in creating stimulus-responsive biomaterials that better recapitulate the dynamic extracellular matrix. Here, a clickable, photodegradable hydrogel substrate that allows the user to precisely control substrate elasticity and topography in situ is presented. The hydrogels are synthesized by reacting an 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) alkyne with an azide-functionalized photodegradable crosslinker. The utility of this platform by exploiting its photoresponsive properties to modulate the phenotype of porcine aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs) is demonstrated. First, VIC phenotype is monitored, in response to initial substratum modulus and static topographic cues. Higher modulus (E ≈ 15 kPa) substrates induce higher levels of activation (≈70\% myofibroblasts) versus soft (E ≈ 3 kPa) substrates (≈20\% myofibroblasts). Microtopographies that induce VIC alignment and elongation on low modulus substrates also stimulate activation. Finally, VIC phenotype is monitored in response to sequential in situ manipulations. The results illustrate that VIC activation on stiff surfaces (≈70\% myofibroblasts) can be partially reversed by reducing surface modulus (≈30\% myofibroblats) and subsequently re-activated by anisotropic topographies (≈60\% myofibroblasts). Such dynamic substrates afford unique opportunities to decipher the complex role of matrix cues on the plasticity of VIC activation.},

	abstract = {After the first description of the myofibroblast in granulation tissue of an open wound by means of electron microscopy, as an intermediate cell between the fibroblast and the smooth muscle cell, the myofibroblast has been identified both in normal tissues, particularly in locations where there is a necessity of mechanical force development, and in pathological tissues, in relation with hypertrophic scarring, fibromatoses and fibrocontractive diseases as well as in the stroma reaction to epithelial tumors. It is now accepted that fibroblast/myofibroblast transition begins with the appearance of the protomyofibroblast, whose stress fibers contain only β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins and evolves, but not necessarily always, into the appearance of the differentiated myofibroblast, the most common variant of this cell, with stress fibers containing α-smooth muscle actin. Myofibroblast differentiation is a complex process, regulated by at least a cytokine (the transforming growth factor-β1), an extracellular matrix component (the ED-A splice variant of cellular fibronectin), as well as the presence of mechanical tension. The myofibroblast is a key cell for the connective tissue remodeling that takes place during wound healing and fibrosis development. On this basis, the myofibroblast may represent a new important target for improving the evolution of such diseases as hypertrophic scars, and liver, kidney or pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {The syncytium of cardiomyocytes in the heart is tethered within a matrix composed principally of type I fibrillar collagen. The matrix has diverse mechanical functions that ensure the optimal contractile efficiency of this muscular pump. In the diseased heart, cardiomyocytes are lost to necrotic cell death, and phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells—termed 'myofibroblasts'—are activated to initiate a 'reparative' fibrosis. The structural integrity of the myocardium is preserved by this scar tissue, although at the expense of its remodelled architecture, which has increased tissue stiffness and propensity to arrhythmias. A persisting population of activated myofibroblasts turns this fibrous tissue into a living 'secretome' that generates angiotensin II and its type 1 receptor, and fibrogenic growth factors (such as transforming growth factor-β), all of which collectively act as a signal–transducer–effector signalling pathway to type I collagen synthesis and, therefore, fibrosis. Persistent myofibroblasts, and the resultant fibrous tissue they produce, cause progressive adverse myocardial remodelling, a pathological hallmark of the failing heart irrespective of its etiologic origin. Herein, we review relevant cellular, subcellular, and molecular mechanisms integral to cardiac fibrosis and consequent remodelling of atria and ventricles with a heterogeneity in cardiomyocyte size. Signalling pathways that antagonize collagen fibrillogenesis provide novel strategies for cardioprotection.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation represents a key event during wound healing and tissue repair. The high contractile force generated by myofibroblasts is beneficial for physiological tissue remodeling but detrimental for tissue function when it becomes excessive such as in hypertrophic scars, in virtually all fibrotic diseases and during stroma reaction to tumors. Specific molecular features as well as factors that control myofibroblast differentiation are potential targets to counteract its development, function, and survival. Such targets include -smooth muscle actin and more recently discovered markers of the myofibroblast cytoskeleton, membrane surface proteins, and the extracellular matrix. Moreover, intervening with myofibroblast stress perception and transmission offers novel strategies to reduce tissue contracture; stress release leads to the instant loss of contraction and promotes apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Tissues lose mechanical integrity when our body is injured. To rapidly restore mechanical stability a multitude of cell types can jump into action by acquiring a reparative phenotype—the myofibroblast. Here, I review the known biomechanics of myofibroblast differentiation and action and speculate on underlying mechanisms. Hallmarks of the myofibroblast are secretion of extracellular matrix, development of adhesion structures with the substrate, and formation of contractile bundles composed of actin and myosin. These cytoskeletal features not only enable the myofibroblast to remodel and contract the extracellular matrix but to adapt its activity to changes in the mechanical microenvironment. Rapid repair comes at the cost of tissue contracture due to the inability of the myofibroblast to regenerate tissue. If contracture and ECM remodeling become progressive and manifests as organ fibrosis, the outcome of myofibroblast activity will have more severe consequences than the initial damage. Whereas the pathological consequences of myofibroblast occurrence are of great interest for physicians, their mechano-responsive features render them attractive for physicists and bioengineers. Their well developed cytoskeleton and responsiveness to a plethora of cytokines fascinate cell biologists and biochemists. Finally, the question of the myofibroblast origin intrigues stem cell biologists and developmental biologists—what else can you ask from a truly interdisciplinary cell?},

We have tested a newly available fluorescent staining kit using ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) and click chemistry to identify EdU incorporation into the replicated DNA of proliferative cells. The proliferation stain was combined with the definitive myofibroblast immunostain for alpha smooth muscle actin (α-sma). Fibroblasts were grown on coverslips and within attached collagen lattices. Cultures were pulsed with EdU 4 h prior to fixation. Different standard methods of fixation and permeabilization were used to test the effects of these variables on EdU and α-sma labeling. Images of the stained samples were quantified as the total percentage of proliferative cells, as well as the proportion of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that were proliferating. Proliferative myofibroblasts were identified in both culture conditions and with all preparation methods tested. Proliferation within the fibroblast population was greater than within the myofibroblast population in both culture conditions. Fixation and permeabilization had little effect on EdU or α-sma labeling. This method of identifying proliferative myofibroblasts will be useful in future studies of myofibroblast proliferation within heterogeneous populations.},

Background

Venous leg ulceration is a recurrent, chronic, disabling condition. It affects up to one in 100 people at some time in their lives. Standard treatments are simple dressings and compression bandages or stockings. Sometimes, despite treatment, ulcers remain open for months or years. Sometimes skin grafts are used to stimulate healing. These may be taken, or grown into a dressing, from the patient's own uninjured skin (autografts), or applied as a sheet of bioengineered skin grown from donor cells (allograft). Preserved skin from other animals, such as pigs, has also been used (xenografts).

Objectives

Search methods

For this update we modified the search strategies and conducted searches of The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 27 July 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE (2008 to July Week 3 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, July 26, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2008 to 2012 Week 29); and EBSCO CINAHL (2008 to 26 July 2012). We did not apply date or language restrictions.

Main results
Main results

For this update of the review, we identified one new trial, bringing the total to 17 trials (1034 participants) - all of which were generally at moderate or high risk of bias. In 12 trials participants also received compression bandaging.
Eleven trials compared a graft with standard care in which no graft was used. Two of these trials (102 participants) compared a dressing with an autograft; three trials (80 participants) compared frozen allografts with dressings, and two trials (45 participants) compared fresh allografts with dressings. Two trials (345 participants) compared tissue-engineered skin (bilayer artificial skin) with a dressing. In two trials (97 participants) a single-layer dermal replacement was compared with standard care.
Six trials compared alternative skin grafting techniques. The first trial (92 participants) compared autografts with frozen allograft, a second (51 participants) compared a pinch graft (autograft) with porcine dermis (xenograft), the third (110 participants) compared growth-arrested human keratinocytes and fibroblasts with placebo, the fourth (10 participants) compared an autograft delivered on porcine pads with an autograft delivered on porcine gelatin microbeads, the fifth trial (92 participants) compared a meshed graft with a cultured keratinocyte autograft, and the sixth trial (50 participants) compared a frozen keratinocyte allograft with a lyophilised (freeze-dried) keratinocyte allografts.
Significantly more ulcers healed when treated with bilayer artificial skin than with dressings. There was insufficient evidence from the other trials to determine whether other types of skin grafting increased the healing of venous ulcers.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

Bilayer artificial skin, used in conjunction with compression bandaging, increases venous ulcer healing compared with a simple dressing plus compression. Further research is needed to assess whether other forms of skin grafts increase ulcer healing.},

	abstract = {Background/Objective:
Research targeting the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of pressure ulcers (PrUs) continue to be a significant priority for clinical and basic science research. Spinal cord injury patients particularly benefit from PrU research, because the prevalence of chronic wounds in this category is increasing despite standardized medical care. Because of practical, ethical, and safety considerations, PrUs in the human environment are limited to studies involving patients with pre-existing ulcers. Therefore, we are limited in our basic knowledge pertaining to the development, progression, and healing environment in this devastating disease.

Methods:
This review provides a synopsis of literature and a discussion of techniques used to induce PrUs in animal models. The question of what animal model best mimics the human PrU environment has been a subject of debate by investigators, peer review panels, and editors. The similarities in wound development and healing in mammalian tissue make murine models a relevant model for understanding the causal factors as well as the wound healing elements. Although we are beginning to understand some of the mechanisms of PrU development, a key dilemma of what makes an apparently healthy tissue develop a PrU waits to be solved.

Results and Conclusions:
No single method of induction and exploring PrUs in animals can address all the aspects of the pathology of chronic wounds. Each model has its particular strengths and weaknesses. Certain types of models can selectively identify specific aspects of wound development, quantify the extent of lesions, and assess outcomes from interventions. The appropriate interpretation of these methods is significant for proper study design, an understanding of the results, and extrapolation to clinical relevance.},

Analysis with multivariate regression methods, adjusting for factors generally thought to influence wound healing (duration, baseline area, depth, location, fibrinous wound bed, and infection), showed that patients treated with Graftskin were twice as likely to achieve complete wound closure by 6 months (p {\textless} 0.005), and over 60\% more effective in achieving wound closure than active control (p {\textless} 0.01).

The aim of the present study was to develop a clinically relevant deep pressure ulcer model in nude mice involving all relevant tissue layers. Balb/c nude mice were anesthetized and a steel disk was implanted under the great gluteus muscle. Full recovery was allowed for 10 days. Pressure was then periodically applied (2 hours compression, 1 hour recovery) using a Neodymium magnet in conjunction with the disk in the unanesthetized mouse. Cycles were repeated for 1, 4, 6, 8, or 10 times. Controls underwent the same procedure without placement of the magnet. The pressure ulcer grade was found to be cycle dependent,with the highest degree after 10 cycles. Histological evaluations revealed signs of necrosis in the skin and subcutaneous fat after four, and in the muscle after eight and 10 cycles of compression. Polymorphnuclear granulocyte infiltration in certain layers was found to be dependent on the number of cycles. We conclude that this clinically relevant nude mouse model can be used to investigate the mechanism of pressure ulcer development and to study new therapeutic approaches.},

The present study was carried out to elucidate the mechanisms. The protein levels of cellular α-smooth muscle actin increased at 2-4 days after TGFβ treatment alone and at 4 to 6 days after a costimulation of bFGF and TGFβ. A spontaneous contraction of stressed myofibroblast-collagen matrix was cancelled by bFGF, which was restored under the presence of C3 exotransferase or Y27632. bFGF stimulation of myofibroblasts as well as fibroblasts elicited a transient Rac and Rho activation. bFGF promoted apoptosis of the myofibroblasts but not of the fibroblasts, even in the presence of two different inhibitors, either LY294002 or an Akt inhibitor. The present study suggests that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase to Akt as well as the Rho to Rho kinase signaling pathway is involved in bFGF-promoted myofibroblast apoptosis, and bFGF can promote the scarless wound healing upon the induction of apoptosis of myofibroblasts, but not fibroblasts.},

	abstract = {A PLA–PCL–PLA triblock copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of successively added ε-caprolactone and dl-lactide in the presence of ethylene glycol, using zinc powder as catalyst. The resulting copolymer was compression molded to yield circular films from which 10×10×0.4 mm3 square samples were cut. These samples were allowed to degrade in isoosmolar 0.13 M, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 °C. Various analytical techniques such as weighing, SEC, 1H NMR, IR, DSC, X-ray, ESEM and CZE were used to monitor property changes during degradation such as water absorption, weight loss, molecular weight distribution, composition, bulk and surface morphologies, thermal behavior, and release of water-soluble oligomers into the aqueous phase. Comparison is made with a PCL homopolymer under similar ageing conditions. The presence of PLA sequences did not alter the ability of PCL segments to crystallize during degradation, in agreement with the microphase separation between PLA and PCL blocks. Large amounts of lactic acid-rich soluble degradation by-products were released into the solution between 18 and 25 weeks. Copolymer films cracked down under drying beyond 25 weeks' degradation, while the surface remained smooth. The copolymer exhibited faster degradation as compared with PCL homopolymer, a feature which is of great interest for temporary therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {As the potential range of stem cell applications in tissue engineering continues to grow, the appropriate scaffolding choice is necessary to create tightly defined artificial microenvironments for each target organ. These microenvironments determine stem cell fate via control over differentiation. In this study we examined the specific effects of scaffold stiffness on embryonic mesenchymal progenitor cell behavior. Mechanically distinct scaffolds having identical microstructures and surface chemistries were produced utilizing core–shell electrospinning. The modulus of core–shell poly(ether sulfone)–poly(ε-caprolactone) (PES–PCL) fibers (30.6 MPa) was more than four times that of pure PCL (7.1 MPa). The results for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells on each scaffold indicate that the lower modulus PCL fibers provided more appropriate microenvironments for chondrogenesis, evident by a marked up-regulation of chondrocytic Sox9, collagen type 2, and aggrecan gene expression and chondrocyte-specific extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan production. In contrast, the stiffer core–shell PES–PCL fibers supported enhanced osteogenesis by promoting osteogenic Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin gene expression, as well as alkaline phosphatase activity. The findings demonstrate that the microstructural stiffness/modules of a scaffold and the pliability of individual fibers may play a critical role in controlling stem cell differentiation. Regulation of cytoskeletal organization may occur via a “dynamic scaffold” leading to the subsequent intracellular signaling events that control differentiation-specific gene expression.},

	abstract = {Aligned electrospun scaffolds are promising tools for engineering fibrous musculoskeletal tissues, as they reproduce the mechanical anisotropy of these tissues and can direct ordered neo-tissue formation. However, these scaffolds suffer from a slow cellular infiltration rate, likely due in part to their dense fiber packing. We hypothesized that cell ingress could be expedited in scaffolds by increasing porosity, while at the same time preserving overall scaffold anisotropy. To test this hypothesis, poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (a slow-degrading polyester) and poly(ethylene oxide) (a water-soluble polymer) were co-electrospun from two separate spinnerets to form dual-polymer composite fiber-aligned scaffolds. Adjusting fabrication parameters produced aligned scaffolds with a full range of sacrificial (PEO) fiber contents. Tensile properties of scaffolds were functions of the ratio of PCL to PEO in the composite scaffolds, and were altered in a predictable fashion with removal of the PEO component. When seeded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), increases in the starting sacrificial fraction (and porosity) improved cell infiltration and distribution after three weeks in culture. In pure PCL scaffolds, cells lined the scaffold periphery, while scaffolds containing \&gt;50\% sacrificial PEO content had cells present throughout the scaffold. These findings indicate that cell infiltration can be expedited in dense fibrous assemblies with the removal of sacrificial fibers. This strategy may enhance in vitro and in vivo formation and maturation of functional constructs for fibrous tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {Despite the attractive features of nanofibrous scaffolds for cell attachment in tissue-engineering (TE) applications, impeded cell ingrowth has been reported in electrospun scaffolds. Previous findings have shown that the scaffold can function as a sieve, keeping cells on the scaffold surface, and that cell migration into the scaffold does not occur in time. Because fiber diameter is directly related to the pore size of an electrospun scaffold, the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate how cell delivery can be optimized by tailoring the fiber diameter of electrospun poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. Five groups of electrospun PCL scaffolds with increasing average fiber diameters (3.4–12.1 μm) were seeded with human venous myofibroblasts. Cell distribution was analyzed after 3 days of culture. Cell penetration increased proportionally with increasing fiber diameter. Unobstructed delivery of cells was observed exclusively in the scaffold with the largest fiber diameter (12.1 μm). This scaffold was subsequently evaluated in a 4-week TE experiment and compared with a poly(glycolic acid)-poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) scaffold, a standard scaffold used successfully in cardiovascular tissue engineering applications. The PCL constructs showed homogeneous tissue formation and sufficient matrix deposition. In conclusion, fiber diameter is a crucial parameter to allow for homogeneous cell delivery in electrospun scaffolds. The optimal electrospun scaffold geometry, however, is not generic and should be adjusted to cell size.},

	abstract = {In this study, the influence of copolymer composition on the physical properties and the degradation behavior of thermoplastic elastomers based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) segments is investigated. These materials are intended to be used in medical applications where degradability of the implant is desired. PEOT/PBT copolymers are microphase separated and up to four thermal transitions are measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Phase separation in the system is enhanced by increasing the molecular weight of starting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or by increasing the PBT content. The mechanical properties, swelling characteristics and degradation rates of the copolymers are influenced by the phase separation. By changing the PEOT/PBT composition, tensile strengths vary from 8 to 23 MPa and elongations at break from 500 to 1300\%. Water uptake ranges from 4 to 210\%. The in vitro degradation of PEOT/PBT copolymers occurs via hydrolysis and oxidation. In both cases, degradation is more rapid for copolymers with high contents of PEO. Deterioration of copolymer films takes place when the films are exposed to light in the absence of antioxidant. In preventing oxidation under daylight conditions, Irganox 1330 turned out to be a more efficient antioxidant for the copolymers than vitamin E.},

	abstract = {We investigated the potential of a nanofiber-based poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold to be used for cartilage reconstruction. The mechanical properties of the nanofiber scaffold, degradation of the scaffold and cellular responses to the scaffold under mechanical stimulation were studied. Three different types of scaffold (lactic acid/glycolic acid content ratio = 75 : 25, 50 : 50, or a blend of 75 : 25 and 50 : 50) were tested. The tensile modulus, ultimate tensile stress and corresponding strain of the scaffolds were similar to those of skin and were slightly lower than those of human cartilage. This suggested that the nanofiber scaffold was sufficiently mechanically stable to withstand implantation and to support regenerated cartilage. The 50 : 50 PLGA scaffold was degraded faster than 75 : 25 PLGA, probably due to the higher hydrophilic glycolic acid content in the former. The nanofiber scaffold was degraded faster than a block-type scaffold that had a similar molecular weight. Therefore, degradation of the scaffold depended on the lactic acid/glycolic acid content ratio and might be controlled by mixing ratio of blend PLGA. Cellular responses were evaluated by examining toxicity, cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation using freshly isolated chondrocytes from porcine articular cartilage. The scaffolds were non-toxic, and cell proliferation and ECM formation in nanofiber scaffolds were superior to those in membrane-type scaffolds. Intermittent hydrostatic pressure applied to cell-seeded nanofiber scaffolds increased chondrocyte proliferation and ECM formation. In conclusion, our nanofiber-based PLGA scaffold has the potential to be used for cartilage reconstruction.},

	abstract = {Biodegradable materials are widely used in the biomedical field because there is no postoperative surgery after implantation. Widely used synthetic biodegradable materials are polyesters, especially those used in tissue engineering. Advances in the tissue engineering field have brought much attention in terms of scaffold fabrication, such as with biodegradable polyester nanofibers. The rationale for using nanofibers for tissue engineering is that the nonwoven polymeric meshwork is a close representation of the nanoscale protein fiber meshwork in native extracellular matrix (ECM). Electrospinning technique is a promising way to fabricate controllable continuous nanofiber scaffold mimicking the ECM structure. Electrospun nanofibers provide high surface-to-volume ratio and high porosity as a promising scaffold for tissue engineering. Because the degradation behaviors of scaffolds significantly affect new tissue regeneration, the degradation of the material becomes one of the crucial factors when considering using polyester nanofibers as scaffolds in tissue engineering. In this review paper, we focus on the degradation studies of several bioresorbable polyester nanofibrous scaffolds used in tissue engineering. The degradable properties of nanofibers were compared with the corresponding degradable materials in macroscale. The factors that might affect the degradation behaviors were analyzed.},

	abstract = {Myofibroblasts play a key role in wound closure but their origin is poorly understood. To investigate whether fibrocytes contribute to myofibroblast population, we examined the phenotype of fibrocytes and myofibroblasts present in the wounded skin of BALB/c mice. During wound healing, there was a marked increase in the number of cells expressing the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin in the granulation tissue. Between 4 and 7 days post-wounding, more than 50\% of these cells also expressed the CD13 antigen. CD13+/collagen I+ fibrocytes could be isolated at an early stage of the healing process from digested fragments of wounded tissue by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Like authentic fibrocytes, these cells were also CD45+/CD34+/CD14−. Between 4 and 7 days post-injury, 61.4\% of the isolated fibrocytes were found to express α-smooth muscle actin gene and protein. We repeated similar experiments in female mice that had received a male whole bone marrow transplant after total body irradiation. By in situ hybridization, we identified the Y chromosome in the nuclei of the majority of fibrocytes isolated from the wounded tissue of these animals. Our data indicate that circulating fibrocytes contribute to the myofibroblast population in the wounded skin and that they originate from the bone marrow.},

	abstract = {The effect of surface functionalization of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) on monocyte/macrophage (MM) behavior is investigated to understand how the physicochemical properties of nanocelluloses influence the interactions of such materials with biological systems. Films of anionic (a-), cationic (c-), and unmodified (u-) NFC were synthesized and characterized in terms of surface charge. THP-1 monocytes were cultured on the surface of the films for 24 h in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide, and the cell response was evaluated in terms of cell adhesion, morphology, and secretion of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-1ra. The results show that MMs cultured on carboxymethylated-NFC films (a-NFC) are activated toward a proinflammatory phenotype, whereas u-NFC promotes a mild activation of the studied cells. The presence of hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium groups on c-NFC, however, does not promote the activation of MMs, indicating that c-NFC closely behaves as an inert material in terms of MM activation. None of the materials is able to directly activate the MMs toward an anti-inflammatory response. These results may provide a foundation for the design of future NFC-based materials with the ability to control MM activation and may expand the use of NFC in biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {The design and control of molecular systems that self-assemble spontaneously and exclusively at or near an interface represents a real scientific challenge. We present here a new concept, an active seed layer that allows to overcome this challenge. It is based on enzyme-assisted self-assembly. An enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, which transforms an original peptide, Fmoc-FFY(PO42−), into an efficient gelation agent by dephosphorylation, is embedded in a polyelectrolyte multilayer and constitutes the “reaction motor”. A seed layer composed of a polyelectrolyte covalently modified by anchoring hydrogelator peptides constitutes the top of the multilayer. This layer is the nucleation site for the Fmoc-FFY peptide self-assembly. When such a film is brought in contact with a Fmoc-FFY(PO42−) solution, a nanofiber network starts to form almost instantaneously which extents up to several micrometers into the solution after several hours. We demonstrate that the active seed layer allows convenient control over the self-assembly kinetics and the geometric features of the fiber network simply by changing its peptide density.},

A readily accessible photoreactive 2H-azirine moiety was designed to absorb light at wavelengths above 400 nm. Irradiation with low-energy light sources thus enables efficient small-molecule synthesis with a diverse range of multiple-bond-containing compounds. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the current approach, quantitative ligation of the photoactivatable chromophore with functional polymeric substrates was performed and full conversion with irradiation times of only 1 min at ambient conditions was achieved. The current report thus presents a highly efficient method for applications involving selective cycloaddition to electron-deficient multiple-bond-containing materials.},

In contrast, the immunogenically subdominant stem region of HA is highly conserved and recognized by antibodies capable of binding multiple HA subtypes. Here we report the structure-based development of an H1 HA stem–only immunogen that confers heterosubtypic protection in mice and ferrets. Six iterative cycles of structure-based design (Gen1–Gen6) yielded successive H1 HA stabilized-stem (HA–SS) immunogens that lack the immunodominant head domain. Antigenic characterization, determination of two HA–SS crystal structures in complex with stem-specific monoclonal antibodies and cryo-electron microscopy analysis of HA–SS on ferritin nanoparticles (H1–SS–np) confirmed the preservation of key structural elements. Vaccination of mice and ferrets with H1–SS–np elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies that completely protected mice and partially protected ferrets against lethal heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza virus challenge despite the absence of detectable H5N1 neutralizing activity in vitro. Passive transfer of immunoglobulin from H1–SS–np–immunized mice to naive mice conferred protection against H5N1 challenge, indicating that vaccine-elicited HA stem–specific antibodies can protect against diverse group 1 influenza strains.},

	abstract = {Nanofibrous membranes have been paid attention in microfiltration. Solution blowing process is a new nanofiber fabricating method with high productivity. In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous mat was successfully solution blown using a multiorifices die. The fibers were mostly 60–280 nm in diameter and three-dimensional curly which resulted in a loose construction with high porosity of 95.8\%. The nanofibrous mat was further hot-pressed to increase its integrality. The structure and microfiltration performance was evaluated. The results showed the crystallinity of the membranes increased, the porosity and pore size decreased after hot-pressing treatment. The hot-pressed membranes showed high retention ratio against microparticles and high pure water flux which will help the solution blown membrane find application in high flux microfiltration.},

Such applications include peptide synthesis, phase transfer catalysis, pharmaceutical modification, protein and cell purifications, polymer-bound reagents, and binding assays. Because of the great deal of interest surrounding this subject, this review will describe generally applicable laboratory methods for preparing PEG derivatives from the parent PEG. We have largely restricted discussion to this starting material because most research laboratories interested in applications are not equipped to handle complex ethylene oxide polymerizations used in large-scale industrial preparations and because PEG and some of its ethers and esters are the only commonly available polymeric starting materials. For the purpose of this review, PEG is defined as those polyoxyethylenes having hydroxyl endgroups and a molecular weight of 20,000 daltons or less.},

	abstract = {Clinical-grade manufacturing of a functional retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) monolayer requires reproducing, as closely as possible, the natural environment in which RPE grows. In vitro, this can be achieved by a tissue engineering approach, in which the RPE is grown on a nanofibrous biological or synthetic scaffold. Recent research has shown that nanofiber scaffolds perform better for cell growth and transplantability compared with their membrane counterparts and that the success of the scaffold in promoting cell growth/function is not heavily material dependent. With these strides, the field has advanced enough to begin to consider implementation of one, or a combination, of the tissue engineering strategies discussed herein. In this study, we review the current state of tissue engineering research for in vitro culture of RPE/scaffolds and the parameters for optimal scaffold design that have been uncovered during this research. Next, we discuss production methods and manufacturers that are capable of producing the nanofiber scaffolds in such a way that would be biologically, regulatory, clinically, and commercially viable. Then, a discussion of how the scaffolds could be characterized, both morphologically and mechanically, to develop a testing process that is viable for regulatory screening is performed. Finally, an example of a tissue-engineered RPE/scaffold construct is given to provide the reader a framework for understanding how these pieces could fit together to develop a tissue-engineered RPE/scaffold construct that could pass regulatory scrutiny and can be commercially successful.},

	abstract = {• The use of fibrin sealant has been advocated to enhance the healing of high-risk intestinal anastomoses. Colonic anastomoses were performed in 162 rats randomly assigned to four groups: control animals with or without fibrin sealant applied to the anastomosis and steroid-treated animals with or without fibrin sealant. At five days postoperatively, the use of steroids alone significantly reduced the anastomotic bursting pressure (ABP) and enhanced abscess and adhesion formation. The addition of fibrin sealant to the anastomosis in steroid-treated animals did not improve ABP and, in fact, further increased abscess formation. In control animals, the use of fibrin sealant also reduced ABP and enhanced abscess and adhesion formation. By ten days, there was no difference in ABP among the groups, and the rate of abscess formation was reduced in all groups. These findings indicated that short-term treatment with steroids delayed colonic anastomotic healing. Fibrin sealant did not enhance the integrity of these high-risk anastomoses. The present data do not support the use of fibrin sealant in high-risk colonic anastomoses.(Arch Surg 1988;123:230-234)},

In order to assess the effect of fibrin glue sealing we compared the healing of sutured colonic anastomosis in the rat (group 1) with the addition of human-derived fibrin sealant (group 2). As a control for a possible reaction to foreign protein, in group 3 the sutured anastomosis was sealed with specially prepared rat fibrin adhesive. On days 2, 4 and 7, ten animals in each group were killed. Adhesion formation was scored and the in situ bursting pressure was measured. The collagen concentration and degradation were estimated by measuring hydroxyproline. Adhesion formation was significantly increased in groups 2 and 3 compared with the control group. On days 2 and 7 the bursting pressure was not different between the groups. On day 4 the bursting pressure in groups 2 and 3 was significantly lower than in group 1 (P less than 0.001). These findings correspond with the results of collagen measurements. On day 4 the concentration of hydroxyproline was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3. Histological examination showed infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes into the sealant on days 2 and 4; on day 7 the sealant had vanished. From these results it is concluded that fibrin sealing of the colonic anastomosis in the rat does not improve healing, as demonstrated by bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentration.

	abstract = {Hypothesis 
An experimental polymeric sealant (CoSeal [Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif]) provides equivalent anastomotic sealing to Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich)/thrombin during surgical placement of prosthetic vascular grafts.Design
Randomized controlled trial.Setting
Nine university-affiliated medical centers.Patients
One hundred forty-eight patients scheduled for implantation of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, mainly for infrainguinal revascularization procedures or the creation of dialysis access shunts, who were treated randomly with either an experimental intervention (n = 74) or control (n = 74).Intervention
Following polytetrafluoroethylene graft placement, anastomotic suture hole bleeding was treated intraoperatively in all control subjects with Gelfoam/thrombin. Subjects in the experimental group had the polymeric sealant applied directly to the suture lines without concomitant manual compression.Main Outcome Measures
Primary treatment success was defined as the proportion of subjects in each group that achieved complete anastomotic sealing within 10 minutes. The proportion of subjects that achieved immediate sealing and the time required to fully inhibit suture hole bleeding also were compared between treatment groups.Results
Overall 10-minute sealing success was equivalent (86\% vs 80\%; P = .29) between experimental and control subjects, respectively. However, subjects treated with CoSeal achieved immediate anastomotic sealing at more than twice the rate of subjects treated with Gelfoam/thrombin (47\% vs 20\%; P{\textless}.001). Consequently, the median time needed to inhibit bleeding in control subjects was more than 10 times longer than for experimental subjects (16.5 seconds vs 189.0 seconds; P = .01). Strikingly similar findings for all comparisons were observed separately for subgroups of subjects having infrainguinal bypass grafting and for those undergoing placement of dialysis access shunts.Conclusions
The experimental sealant offers equivalent anastomotic sealing performance compared with Gelfoam/thrombin, but it provides this desired effect in a significantly more rapid time frame.},

The incorporation of etheric oxygen allowed the production of flexible monomers with good adhesive strength. Monomers with longer side-chains were found to have less toxicity both in vitro and in vivo.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality due to anastomotic complications in gastrointestinal surgery remain important problems. The tissue adhesive N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NB2CA) is used in many fields of surgery. This study was designed to assess the effects of NB2CA on high-level jejunojejunostomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male albino Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups of 10 each. The groups were treated as follows: group 1 underwent only a jejunojejunostomy, group 2 underwent jejunojejunostomy followed by NB2CA application around the anastomosis, group 3 underwent jejunojejunostomy after a 60-min ischemia and a 60-min reperfusion, and group 4 underwent jejunojejunostomy after a 60-min ischemia and a 60-min reperfusion followed by NB2CA application around the anastomosis. At postoperative day 7, the subjects in all groups were sacrificed. Intra-abdominal adhesions, anastomotic complications and anastomotic burst pressures (ABP) were recorded.
RESULTS: The analysis of all the groups for adhesion scores and ABP showed statistical significance (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of NB2CA had positive effects in terms of increasing ABP both with and without the initial ischemia- reperfusion insult. However, it had the adverse effect of significantly increasing the number of intra-abdominal adhesions.},

Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats were randomized into four experimental groups (n = 10 in each group). In group 1 (control), a well-perfused left colonic segment was transected, and free ends were anastomosed by propylene sutures. In groups 2, 3, and 4, the animals underwent a standardized surgical procedure to induce ischemic left colon anastomosis. In group 2, an end-to-end anastomosis was created using six interrupted 6-0 polypropylene sutures between ischemic edges. In group 3, after approximating the mesenteric and antimesenteric edges of the anastomosis with two 6-0 polypropylene sutures, 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate was applied between the edges. In group 4, anastomosis was created by the same technique as described in group 2, and additionally 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate was applied on suture line. Rats were killed on day 4 following operation. Anastomotic integrity, intraperitoneal adhesion scores, anastomotic bursting pressures, and tissue hydroxyproline levels were recorded. Histopathological examination of the anastomosis was also performed. Results: There were no statistically significant differences among groups with respect to anastomotic integrity (p =.142). The mean bursting pressure values were 81.1 ± 23.83, 43.3 ± 26.06, 15.8 ± 11.3, and 17.6 ± 18.02 in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among groups 2, 3, and 4 with respect to tissue hydroxyproline levels and bursting pressure levels. The highest adhesion scores were observed in groups 3 and 4. Discussion: 2-octyl cyanoacrylate does not have additional advantages in the healing of experimental ischemic colon anastomosis.},

	abstract = {Background:  Cyanoacrylates have been advocated as a protective seal in colonic anastomosis to prevent leakage. In order to assess the effects of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate on left colonic anastomosis it was compared to the sutured anastomosis in the rat. Methods:  Forty male Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups of 20 each. On days 3 and 7, 10 animals in each goup were killed. The comparisons between n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and sutured groups were made with respect to outcome measures including anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, peritonitis and wound infections, and adhesion formation, anastomotic bursting pressure, histological appearance of the anastomotic area. Results:  Although the adhesion formation was significantly more extensive in the n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group on day 3 (P {\textless} 0.001), there was no significant difference between the groups on day 7. The more inflammatory reaction also occurred in the n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group. The mean ± SD anastomotic bursting pressure was significantly higher in the suture group than in the n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group (63 ± 14 mmHg vs 43 ± 8 mmHg) on day 3. The bursting pressure was also found to be higher on day 7 in the suture group (187 ± 26 mmHg vs 49 ± 12 mmHg, P {\textless} 0.0001). The suture group had a significantly higher bursting pressure on day 7 compared to day 3 (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions:  Left colonic anastomosis with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in rats does not improve the healing process; on the contrary, it has a negative influence during the first week.

Currently, there are no clinically approved surgical glues that are nontoxic, bind strongly to tissue, and work well within wet and highly dynamic environments within the body. This is especially relevant to minimally invasive surgery that is increasingly performed to reduce postoperative complications, recovery times, and patient discomfort. We describe the engineering of a bioinspired elastic and biocompatible hydrophobic light-activated adhesive (HLAA) that achieves a strong level of adhesion to wet tissue and is not compromised by preexposure to blood. The HLAA provided an on-demand hemostatic seal, within seconds of light application, when applied to high-pressure large blood vessels and cardiac wall defects in pigs. HLAA-coated patches attached to the interventricular septum in a beating porcine heart and resisted supraphysiologic pressures by remaining attached for 24 hours, which is relevant to intracardiac interventions in humans. The HLAA could be used for many cardiovascular and surgical applications, with immediate application in repair of vascular defects and surgical hemostasis.},

Secondary reactions can be used to create a variety of ad-layers, including self-assembled monolayers through deposition of long-chain molecular building blocks, metal films by electroless metallization, and bioinert and bioactive surfaces via grafting of macromolecules.
A wide variety of surfaces can be coated with a slightly basic dopamine solution, creating a universal adhesive that can be readily modified by secondary reactions.

The highest adhesion strength and burst pressure could reach to 2.99 MPa and 35 mmHg, respectively. The photopolymerization process of Dex-U was monitored by real time infrared spectroscopy (RTIR), and the surface tension of Dex-U solution was tested by du Nouy Ring method. The cytotoxicity of Dex-U also was evaluated. The relationship between all above properties and degree of substitution of Dex-U was assessed. The adhesive strength of Dex-U is significantly higher than that of fibrin glue. The obtained products present the potential to serve as tissue adhesive in medical area in the future.},

Cytotoxicity of tissue adhesives was evaluated by placing adhesives in direct contact with 3T3 fibroblast cells. Polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives composed of dextran aldehyde and star PEG amine were non-cytotoxic to fibroblasts; in contrast, a commercial adhesive composed of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate was highly cytotoxic to fibroblasts. The inflammatory potential of tissue adhesives was evaluated by exposing J774 macrophage cells to adhesives, and measuring TNF-α release from macrophages. Polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives did not elicit inflammatory TNF-α release from macrophages. These results suggest that polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives are non-cytotoxic and non-inflammatory; the results are therefore significant in the design of in vitro cell culture systems to study biomaterials.},

	abstract = {There is a significant medical need for tough biodegradable polymer adhesives that can adapt to or recover from various mechanical deformations while remaining strongly attached to the underlying tissue. We approached this problem by using a polymer poly(glycerol-co-sebacate acrylate) and modifying the surface to mimic the nanotopography of gecko feet, which allows attachment to vertical surfaces. Translation of existing gecko-inspired adhesives for medical applications is complex, as multiple parameters must be optimized, including: biocompatibility, biodegradation, strong adhesive tissue bonding, as well as compliance and conformability to tissue surfaces. Ideally these adhesives would also have the ability to deliver drugs or growth factors to promote healing. As a first demonstration, we have created a gecko-inspired tissue adhesive from a biocompatible and biodegradable elastomer combined with a thin tissue-reactive biocompatible surface coating. Tissue adhesion was optimized by varying dimensions of the nanoscale pillars, including the ratio of tip diameter to pitch and the ratio of tip diameter to base diameter. Coating these nanomolded pillars of biodegradable elastomers with a thin layer of oxidized dextran significantly increased the interfacial adhesion strength on porcine intestine tissue in vitro and in the rat abdominal subfascial in vivo environment. This gecko-inspired medical adhesive may have potential applications for sealing wounds and for replacement or augmentation of sutures or staples.},

	abstract = {PurposeExperimental and clinical studies on the sealing of colorectal anastomoses in order to reduce the rate of leakage have previously been performed with divergent results. However, comparatively few studies have been performed on anastomotic healing using a fibrin glue-coated patch. The aim of this experimental basic scientific study in mice was to investigate the effect of fibrin glue-coated collagen patches on the healing process of colonic anastomoses in situations of adverse healing process (technical deficiency and peritonitis).MethodsColonic anastomoses were carried out in 206 mice and randomized into six groups (I: complete anastomoses, II: sealed complete anastomoses, III: incomplete anastomoses, IV: sealed incomplete anastomoses, V: complete anastomoses in the presence of bacterial peritonitis, VI: sealed complete anastomoses in the presence of bacterial peritonitis). Tissues from the anastomoses were removed and used for functional, histochemical, molecular, and biochemical investigations.ResultsThe evaluation of postoperative course data revealed the beneficial effect of additional sealing with a fixed combination of collagen matrix-bound coagulation factors I and IIa (Tachosil®, Nycomed Austria, Linz) in high-risk experimental anastomotic healing. Sealing incomplete anastomoses resulted in significantly lower lethality and leakage rates, as well as significantly higher bursting pressure values and histopathologic scores. Collagen 1 and 3 expressions and hydroxyproline concentrations are greatly increased with additional sealing in all high-risk anastomoses.ConclusionsIn our current model, we demonstrate that additionally sealing high-risk experimental colonic anastomoses provides a positive effect on the healing process. The effect on the molecular level in particular seems to be essential and requires further experimental studies to evaluate the mechanism.},

	abstract = {Background:
Anastomotic leak after gastrointestinal surgery is an important postoperative event that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Postoperative leak rates are frequently used as an indicator of the quality of surgical care provided. Comparison of rates between and within institutions depends on the use of standard definitions and methods of measurement of anastomotic leak. The aim of this study was to review the definition and measurement of anastomotic leak after oesophagogastric, hepatopancreaticobiliary and lower gastrointestinal surgery.
Methods:
A systematic review was undertaken of the published literature. Searches were carried out on five bibliographical databases (Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature and HealthSTAR) for English language articles published between 1993 and 1999. Articles were critically appraised by two independent reviewers and data on definition and measurement of anastomotic leak were extracted.
Results:
Ninety-seven studies were reviewed and a total of 56 separate definitions of anastomotic leak were identified at three sites: upper gastrointestinal (13 definitions), hepatopancreaticobiliary (14) and lower gastrointestinal (29). The majority of studies used a combination of clinical features and radiological investigations to define and detect anastomotic leak.
Conclusion:
There is no universally accepted definition of anastomotic leak at any site. The definitions and values used to measure anastomotic failure vary extensively and preclude accurate comparison of rates between studies and institutions. © 2001 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

	abstract = {High-surface-area activated carbon obtained from ultra-thin PAN fibers was evaluated as CO2 adsorbent in a simulated flue gas stream. These carbons were prepared from ultra-thin PAN fibers by means of stabilization, activation, and carbonization. By changing the stabilization temperature, it is possible to control the pore size from supermicropores (0.7–2.0 nm) to mesopores (2–5.5 nm). The surface area of the carbon can be over 2500 m2g−1. Both textural properties and nitrogen functionality influence the CO2 adsorption performance of the adsorbents. The ultra-thin PAN fibers stabilized at 533 K (AC533) achieved the highest CO2 gravimetric equilibrium capacity of 5.53 mmol g−1 in a binary mixture of 15\% CO2 in N2 at 323 K, while AC493 had the highest CO2 dynamic adsorption of 2.70 mmol g−1 in a N2/CO2/H2O mixture (83/10/7\% v/v) at 323 K. The textural properties, the micropore surface and micropore volume obtained from micropores below 1.1 nm, have a significant effect on CO2 dynamic adsorption. The stabilization temperature affects the nitrogen group present, as determined by XPS, which enhances the specific adsorbent-adsorbate interaction for CO2.},

Glutaraldehyde (GA) vapor was then applied to impart stability, and the cross-linking reaction mainly occurred between GA and hydroxyl groups which was confirmed by XPS. The hydrogel nanofibers showed quick absorption behavior, high equilibrate water absorption and good air permeability which could help the mats absorbing excess exudates, creating a moist wound healing environment and oxygen exchanging in wound healing. The mats also exhibited good antibacterial activities against E. coil. The combination advantages of nanofibers mats and hydrogel will help it find promising application in wound healing.},

	abstract = {In this work filtration efficiency of commercially available filter media with fiber/pore sizes of the scale of 10 μm is dramatically increased by not only adding electrospun nanofibers, as is usually done, but also a layer of ultrafine supersonically blown 20–50 nm nanofibers. Three different commercially available base filters were modified with (i) electrospun nanofibers alone, (ii) solution-blown 20–50 nm nanofibers alone, and (iii) the dual coating with electrospun nanofibers deposited first and the solution-blown 20–50 nm nanofibers deposited on top of them. Detailed observations of nanoparticle removal by these base and the above-mentioned modified filters revealed that the filters with dual electrospun nanofibers (deposited first) and the solution-blown 20–50 nm nanofibers deposited on top of them are the most effective in removing the below-200 nm Cu nanoparticles/clusters from aqueous suspensions. Experiments were conducted in two different time ranges: (a) for 8–15 s, and (b) for 8 min. It was found that the efficiency of the dual-coated filters containing 20–50 nm fibers was significantly higher than those of the others at the lowest nanoparticle concentrations of 0.2–0.5 ppm in suspension. The experiments conducted for longer time revealed that the smallest nanofibers were as efficient in particle retention as in the shorter-time experiments, and there was no visible breakage pattern of these nanofibers. The theory developed in the present work explains and describes how the smallest solution-blown nanofibers introduce a novel physical mechanism of nanoparticle interception (the attractive van der Waals forces) and become significantly more efficient collectors compared to the larger electrospun nanofibers. The theory predicts the domain of nanoparticle collection due to the van der Waals forces. The theory also elucidates the morphology of the nanoparticle clusters being accumulated at the smallest nanofiber surfaces, including the clusters growing at the windward side, or in some cases also on the leeward side of a nanofiber.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a systematic study of the release kinetics of two embedded model drugs (one completely water soluble and one partially water soluble) from hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanofiber mats was conducted. Fluorescent dye Rhodamine B was used as a model hydrophilic drug in controlled release experiments after it was encapsulated in solution-blown soy-protein-containing hydrophilic nanofibers as well as in electrospun hydrophobic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)-containing nanofibers. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), a partially water-soluble model drug, was also encapsulated in hydrophobic PET-containing nanofiber mats, and its release kinetics was studied. The nanofiber mats were submerged in water, and the amount of drug released was tracked by fluorescence intensity. It was found that the release process saturates well below 100\% release of the embedded compound. This is attributed to the fact that desorption is the limiting process in the release from biopolymer-containing nanofibers similar to the previously reported release from petroleum-derived polymer nanofibers. Release from monolithic as well as core–shell nanofibers was studied in the present work. Moreover, to facilitate the release and ultimately to approach 100\% release, we also incorporated porogens, for example, poly(ethylene glycol), PEG. It was also found that the release rate can be controlled by the porogen choice in nanofibers. The effect of nanocracks created by leaching porogens on drug release was studied experimentally and evaluated theoretically, and the physical parameters characterizing the release process were established. The objective of the present work is a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation of controlled drug release from nanofibers facilitated by the presence of porogens. The novelty of this work is in forming nanofibers containing biodegradable and biocompatible soy proteins to facilitate controlled drug release as well as in measuring detailed quantitative characteristics of the desorption processes responsible for release of the model substance (fluorescent dye) and the vitamin (riboflavin) in the presence of porogens.},

	abstract = {Background
In colorectal surgery, anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most significant complication. Sealants applied around the colon anastomosis may help prevent AL by giving the anastomosis time to heal by mechanically supporting the anastomosis and preventing bacteria leaking into the peritoneal cavity. The aim of this study is to compare commercially available sealants on their efficacy of preventing leakage in a validated mouse model for AL.
Methods
Six sealants (Evicel, Omnex, VascuSeal, PleuraSeal, BioGlue, and Colle Chirurgicale Cardial) were applied around an anastomosis constructed with five interrupted sutures in mice, and compared with a control group without sealant. Outcome measures were AL, anastomotic bursting pressure, and death.
Results
In the control group there was a 40\% death rate with a 50\% rate of AL. None of the sealants were able to diminish the rate of AL. Furthermore, use of the majority of sealants resulted in failure to thrive, increased rates of ileus, and higher mortality rates.
Conclusions
If sealing of a colorectal anastomosis could achieve a reduction of incidence of clinical AL, this would be a promising tool for prevention of leakage in colorectal surgery. In this study, we found no evidence that sealants reduce leakage rates in a mouse model for AL. However, the negative results of this study make us emphasize the need of systemic research, investigating histologic tissue reaction of the bowel to different sealants, the capacity of sealants to form a watertight barrier, their time of degradation, and finally their results in large animal models for AL.},

Meshed autologous skin grafts are generally regarded as the standard treatment for extensive full-thickness burns. Graft take and rate of wound healing, however, depend on several endogenous factors. This paper describes a standardized reproducible porcine model of burn and skin grafting which can be used to study the effects of topical treatments on graft take and re-epithelialization., Procedures provide a protocol for successful porcine burn wound experiments with special focus on pre-operative care, anesthesia, burn allocation, excision and grafting, postoperative treatment, dressing application, and specimen collection. Selected outcome measurements include percent area of wound closure by planimetry, wound assessment using a clinical assessment scale, and histological scoring., The use of this standardized model provides burn researchers with a valuable tool for the comparison of different topical drug treatments and dressing materials in a setting that closely mimics clinical reality.},

	abstract = {The glue proteins secreted by marine mussels bind strongly to virtually all inorganic and organic surfaces in aqueous environments in which most adhesives function poorly. Studies of these functionally unique proteins have revealed the presence of the unusual amino acid 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (dopa), which is formed by posttranslational modification of tyrosine. However, the detailed binding mechanisms of dopa remain unknown, and the chemical basis for mussels’ ability to adhere to both inorganic and organic surfaces has never been fully explained. Herein, we report a single-molecule study of the substrate and oxidation-dependent adhesive properties of dopa. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of a single dopa residue contacting a wet metal oxide surface reveal a surprisingly high strength yet fully reversible, noncovalent interaction. The magnitude of the bond dissociation energy as well as the inability to observe this interaction with tyrosine suggests that dopa is critical to adhesion and that the binding mechanism is not hydrogen bond formation. Oxidation of dopa, as occurs during curing of the secreted mussel glue, dramatically reduces the strength of the interaction to metal oxide but results in high strength irreversible covalent bond formation to an organic surface. A new picture of the interfacial adhesive role of dopa emerges from these studies, in which dopa exploits a remarkable combination of high strength and chemical multifunctionality to accomplish adhesion to substrates of widely varying composition from organic to metallic.},

The recent report of 5,5‘-di(dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine) (diDOPA) cross-links in byssus [McDowell et al. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20293] has raised questions about the relationship of these to mefp1. About 80\% of the primary structure of mefp1 consists of a tandemly repeated consensus sequence Ala1-Lys2-Pro3-Ser4-Tyr5-Pro6-Pro7-Thr8-Tyr9-Lys10 with varying degrees of posttranslational hydroxylation to hydroxyprolines in positions 3, 6, and 7 and to DOPA in positions 5 and 9. Six natural or synthetic variants of this decapeptide were subjected to oxidation by tyrosinase or periodate. DOPA is the only residue to suffer losses in all oxidized peptides. Moreover, using MALDI TOF mass spectrometry, oxidized decapeptides all showed evidence of multimer formation and a mass loss of 6 Da per coupled pair of peptides. Multimer formation was inhibited by addition of DOPA-like o-diphenols, but addition of simple amines such as free Lys had no effect. The results are consistent with aryloxy coupling to diDOPA followed by reoxidation to diDOPA quinone. There are subtle but noteworthy variations, however, in multimer formation among the peptide congeners. Decapeptides with Pro3 modified to trans-4-hydroxyproline do not form multimers beyond dimers; they also exhibit significant Lys losses following oxidation of DOPA. Moreover, in Ala-Lys-Hyp-Ser-Tyr-DiHyp-Hyp-Thr-DOPA-Lys, Tyr appears to be protected from oxidation by tyrosinase.},

	abstract = {The cross-linking behavior of mussel adhesive protein Mefp-1 was studied by measuring the rate of aggregation of the protein by photon correlation spectroscopy. To be able to calculate the aggregation numbers, the hydrodynamic radius of monomer Mefp-1 (10 nm) was determined under reducing conditions. The aggregation is controlled by the redox potential of the solution, and the aggregation number varied, independent of pH, over a factor 2 within the experimentally accessible redox potential window. A kinetic model for cross-linking, based on the intricate interplay of the oxidation and auto-oxidation of the hydroquinones of Mefp-1, is proposed. The oxidation rate strongly depends on redox potential. The cross-linking rate is taken to be proportional to the rate of auto-oxidation. The model correctly predicts the experimentally observed phenomena. When the oxidation rate is slower than the auto-oxidation rate, cross-linking is efficient and controlled by the oxidation rate. When the rate of auto-oxidation rate is slower than the oxidation rate, the cross-linking is inefficient due to the quick exhaustion of the hydroquinones. The experimentally determined rate constant for cross-linking is found to be much smaller than those found for auto-oxidation of hydroquinones because of the excluded volume interactions imposed by the protein backbone. Tuning the interplay between oxidation and auto-oxidation presents the potential of controlling cross-linking density independent of the density of reactive groups.},

Metal levels (e.g., Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) of the cured glue are significantly concentrated relative to surrounding waters. Specific details on the reagents used by mussels to induce protein cross-linking are not known at this time. To provide insight on the cross-linking agents and reactions taking place while curing mussel glues, we performed a study in which various compounds were tested for the ability to bring about protein curing. A precursor to adhesion, with proteins containing the unusual amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, was extracted from mussel feet. Potential cross-linking agents were mixed with this gelatinous pellet. The compressibility and shear properties of the resulting material were investigated by use of a penetration test. The reagents examined included simple metal ions (e.g., Na+, Zn2+), oxidizing transition metals (e.g., Fe3+, Cr2O72-), nonmetallic oxidants (e.g., H2O2, IO4-), and oxidizing enzymes (e.g., tyrosinase). We found that protein curing was brought about by simple oxidants and transition metal ions. The results show that optimal curing occurs when the reagent is an oxidizing metal ion (e.g., MnO4-, Fe3+). We conclude that marine mussels are likely to employ Mn3+ and Fe3+ for protein cross-linking and adhesive synthesis.},

Associated with temporary adhesion is a capacity for conspecific recognition which can be simulated by spreading adsorbed layers of integumentary protein on a suitable solid surface. The mechanism of recognition is not fully understood and there remain problems in understanding why adsorbates, ubiquitously present in natural sea waters, or thick biofilms, do not appear to interfere with the tactile chemical sense. Both mussels and barnacles show a preference for adherends to which the natural cement will eventually form a stronger bond.},

	abstract = {Dextran has recently been investigated as an alternative to polyethylene glycol (PEG) for low protein-binding, cell-resistant coatings on biomaterial surfaces. Although anti-fouling properties of surface-grafted dextran and PEG are quite similar, the multivalent properties of dextran are advantageous when high-density surface immobilization of biologically active molecules to low protein-binding surface coatings is desired. The preferred methods of dextran immobilization for biomaterial applications should be simple with minimal toxicity. In this report, a method is described for covalent immobilization of dextran to material surfaces which involves low residual toxicity reagents in mild aqueous reaction conditions. 70 kDa MW dextran was immobilized on glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces. 3T3 fibroblast cell adhesion was compared on untreated, aminated, and dextran-coated materials. Dextran coatings effectively limited cell adhesion and spreading on glass and PET surfaces in the presence of serum-borne cell adhesion proteins. With dextran-based surface coatings, it will be possible to develop well-defined surface modifications that promote specific cell interactions and perhaps better performance in long-term biomaterial implants.},

The cytotoxicities of this hydrogel, two semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings (Tegaderm and OpSite), and a hydrocolloid dressing (DuoDERM) were compared by measuring cell survival with the tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT) assay after incubations of the wound dressing samples for up to 6d, in the presence of—but not in direct contact with—the cells. In vitro, the degree of cytotoxicity of the new hydrogel was greater in keratinocyte cultures than in fibroblast and endothelial cell cultures, and increased upon longer incubation time. In keratinocyte cultures, the semi-occlusive polyurethane dressings, the hydrocolloid, and the hydrogel dressings induced low, high and acceptable degrees of cytotoxicity, respectively. The toxicity of the isolated hydrogel components was assessed in Balb MK keratinocyte cultures. In these cells, epidermal growth-factor-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA was higher in the presence of gelatin. By contrast, concentrations of dextran dialdehyde as low as 0.002\% were found to significantly decrease thymidine incorporation (P{\textless}0.01). Subcutaneous implantation studies in mice showed that in vivo the hydrogel was biocompatible since the foreign body reaction seen around the implanted hydrogel samples was moderate and became minimal upon increasing implantation time. These results indicate that dextran dialdehyde cross-linked gelatin hydrogels have an appropriate biocompatibility.},

Oxidized dextran was proved to be toxic against the RAW 264.7 cell line with an IC50 of 3 μmol/mL aldehydes. Modification of aldehyde groups and their reaction with ethanolamine reduced the toxicity at least 15-fold. Accordingly, the antifungal and antileishmanial dextran−AmB imine conjugate, which contains unreacted aldehyde groups, was modified with ethanolamine and compared to dextran−AmB amine and imine conjugates. Modification of the imine conjugate with ethanolamine reduced its toxicity toward the RAW cell line by 100\%. The effect on Leishmania major parasites was 5 times higher than that of the dextran−AmB amine conjugate. The dextran−AmB−ethanolamine conjugate was at least 15 times less hemolytic than free AmB. Stability and drug release profiles in buffer solution were investigated. The imine conjugates released free AmB while the amine conjugate did not. It is concluded that aldehyde groups may contribute to cell toxicity. This toxicity is reduced by converting the aldehyde groups into imine conjugates with ethanolamine. The results have direct implications toward the safety of AmB−polysaccharide conjugates used against fungal and leishmanial infections.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study was undertaken to test injectable surgical sealants that are biocompatible with fetal membranes and that are to be used eventually for the closure of iatrogenic membrane defects.
Study Design
Dermabond (Ethicon Inc, Norderstedt, Germany), Histoacryl (B. Braun GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany), and Tissucol (Baxter AG, Volketwil, Switzerland) fibrin glue, and 3 types of in situ forming poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer hydrogels were tested for acute toxicity on direct contact with fetal membranes for 24 hours. For the determination of elution toxicity, extracts of sealants were incubated on amnion cell cultures for 72 hours. Bonding and toxicity was assessed through morphologic and/or biochemical analysis.
Results
Extracts of all adhesives were nontoxic for cultured cells. However, only Tissucol and 1 type of poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogel, which is a mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive, showed efficient, nondisruptive, nontoxic bonding to fetal membranes. Mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive that was applied over membrane defects that were created with a 3.5-mm trocar accomplished leak-proof closure that withstood membrane stretch in an in vitro model.
Conclusion
A synthetic hydrogel-type tissue adhesive that merits further evaluation in vivo emerged as a potential sealing modality for iatrogenic membrane defects.},

	abstract = {Electrospinning has been applied to prepare uniaxially aligned nanofibers made of organic polymers, ceramics, and polymer/ceramic composites. The key to the success of this method was the use of a collector consisting of two pieces of electrically conductive substrates separated by a gap whose width could be varied from hundreds of micrometers to several centimeters. As driven by electrostatic interactions, the charged nanofibers were stretched to span across the gap and thus to become uniaxially aligned arrays over large areas. Because the nanofibers were suspended over the gap, they could be conveniently transferred onto the surfaces of other substrates for subsequent treatments and various applications. Materials that have been successfully incorporated into this procedure include conventional organic polymers, graphite carbon, and metal oxides. By controlling the parameters for electrospinning, we have also fabricated a number of simple device structures, for example, an individual nanofiber spanning across two electrodes, 2D arrays of crossbar junctions, and optical polarizers.},

	abstract = {Chitosan-based nanofibers with an average fiber diameter controllable from a few microns down to ∼40 nm and a narrow size distribution were fabricated by electrospinning solutions containing chitosan, polyethylene oxide (PEO), and Triton X-100™. Rheological study showed a strong dependence of spinnability and fiber morphology on solution viscosity and thus on chitosan-to-PEO ratio. The nanofibers can be deposited either as a nonwoven mat or as a highly aligned bundle of controllable size. Potential use of this nanofibrous matrix for tissue engineering was studied by examining its integrity in water and cellular compatibility. It was found that the matrix with a chitosan/PEO ratio of 90/10 retained excellent integrity of the fibrous structure in water. Experimental results from cell stain assay and SEM imaging showed that the nanofibrous structure promoted the attachment of human osteoblasts and chondrocytes and maintained characteristic cell morphology and viability throughout the period of study. This nanofibrous matrix is of particular interest in tissue engineering for controlled drug release and tissue remodeling.},

The goal of this comprehensive, sequential review is to update these components to include those now available (February 2012) as well as to explore cost and regulatory factors that impact the development and use of these materials. A unique system of definitions for organizing these components based on group, category, and class is used as a means of improving the understanding and appropriate use of these materials. The system will be used here to present the most recent additions to the toolbox, which are evaluated based on safety, efficacy, usability, and cost. These new additions include pooled human plasma fibrinogen and thrombin embedded in an equine collagen patch for cardiac surgical hemostasis, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and human serum albumin for lung surgical pneumostasis, modified PEG and trilysine amine for spinal sealing, octyl and butyl lactoyl cyanoacrylate for vascular sealing, and a variety of octyl and butyl cyanoacrylates with or without dyes and/or polyester mesh for skin closure with the creation of a bacterial barrier. The system of definitions will also be used to clarify key strategies in the current health care environment for reducing costs and for increasing understanding of Food and Drug Administration regulatory decisions for these materials.},

	abstract = {The influence of the addition of silica (Aerosil-200) (5-25 wt\%) to polyurethane adhesives on their adhesion properties with non-chlorinated and surface-chlorinated rubbers has been studied. The chlorinating agent was Trichloroisocyanuric acid (TIC) in 2-butanone solution at a concentration of between 1 and 9 wt\%. In general, silica produced an increase in the adhesive viscosity and an improvement of green (immediate) peel strength (especially with chlorinated rubber). The best results were obtained for a silica content of 10-20 wt\%. However, the addition of silica did not improve the peel strength after a thermal ageing process. Polyurethane adhesives containing silica undergo an improvement in their resistance to degradation by chlorine on the rubber surface. On the other hand, the chlorination of silica produces the rupture of Si-O bonds and the formation of Si-H and Si-Cl groups. Furthermore, the stirring speed (directly related to the dispersion) of silica into the adhesive is an important parameter which affects the viscosity and peel strength. A stirring speed of 1000 rpm gives the best silica dispersion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A two-component sealant composed of bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) is used to treat aortic dissections. Although glutaraldehyde guarantees strong adherence to tissues and synthetic materials, its toxic potential should be considered. The aim of this study was to determine the amount of glutaraldehyde released from BioGlue, its cytotoxic effects on cultured cells, and the local reaction of lung, liver, and aortic tissues to BioGlue.
METHODS: BioGlue was prepared according to the product insert, allowed to polymerize, and then overlaid with saline solution. The supernatant was analyzed for its content of glutaraldehyde. The cytotoxic effect of BioGlue was evaluated by adding the supernatants to either cultured human embryo fibroblasts (MRC5) or mouse myoblasts (C2C12). In vivo toxicity was assessed on three different tissues by applying BioGlue onto a partial lung resection, a liver abrasion, or an intact abdominal aorta in rabbits. Tissue samples were histologically evaluated 2 and 7 days after application.
RESULTS: Saline supernatants from polymerized BioGlue contained 100 to 200 mug/mL glutaraldehyde and were cytotoxic to both cell lines tested. Application of BioGlue to lung and liver tissue evoked serious adverse effects consisting of high-grade inflammation, edema, and toxic necrosis. Intact aortic tissue showed only low-grade or medium-grade inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymerized BioGlue releases amounts of glutaraldehyde that are capable of inducing cytotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo. Use of BioGlue should be restricted to the aortic dissection procedure, as other tissues are sensitive to the amounts of glutaraldehyde released from the glue.},

	abstract = {Surface immobilized polyethylene oxide (PEO) has been shown to efficiently reduce protein adsorption and cellular adhesion, resulting in a biologically passive surface. To explore the in vitro effects of surface immobilized PEO on the human inflammatory cells, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), we developed a diisocyanate-based method for coupling PEO to amine-modified glass, a surface previously shown to enhance macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation. Contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of PEO molecules bound to the surface and revealed that PEO molecular weight significantly influenced the efficiency of PEO coupling. We used a 10-day human monocyte culture protocol to demonstrate that the presence of surface coupled PEO molecules does not significantly decrease initial monocyte density or monocyte-derived macrophage density after 3 days. However, PEO-coupled surfaces significantly reduced long-term monocyte-derived macrophage density and virtually eliminated interleukin-4-induced FBGC formation observed at day 10. The cellular response to these PEO-coupled surfaces was related to the molecular weight of the PEO chains, which was varied between 200 Da and 18.5 kDa. These results suggest that an optimized PEO surface treatment may be effective in reducing inflammatory cell adhesion and possible degradation during the inflammatory response to an implanted biomedical device.},

Novel homogeneous surfaces were utilized to mediate adhesion. These surfaces consisted of N-(2 aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (EDS) and an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) of polyacrylamide and poly(ethylene glycol). These surfaces were designed to control cell adhesion and morphology and mediate cell differentiation, activation, metabolic ability, and apoptosis, resulting in a reduced or controlled inflammatory response. The EDS surface promotes cell adhesion and the IPN minimizes protein adsorption and subsequent cell adhesion. Both surfaces had similar cellular adhesion rates at each respective time point. However, the adherent macrophage morphology was similar at 2 h and day 3, and at days 7 and 10 adherent macrophages on the EDS surface formed FBGCs (46\% at day 7 and 40\% at day 10). Adherent cells on the IPN surface did not form FBGCs but instead formed monocyte aggregates (73\% of adherent cells formed aggregates at day 7 and 63\% at day 10). It is indicated that the two surface chemistries differentially controlled monocyte differentiation into macrophages and subsequent macrophage fusion to form FBGCs.},

	abstract = {For many patients, rectal catheters are an effective means to manage bowel incontinence. Unfortunately, the incidence of catheter leakage in these patients remains troublingly high. Matching the mechanical properties of the catheter and the surrounding tissue may improve the catheter seal and reduce leakage. However, little data is available on the mechanical properties of colorectal tissue. Therefore, our group examined the mechanical properties of colorectal tissue obtained from both a common animal model and humans. Uniaxial tension tests were performed to determine the effects of location, orientation, and species (porcine and human) on bowel tissue tensile mechanical properties. Bowel tissue ultimate strength, elongation at failure, and elastic modulus were derived from these tests and statistically analyzed. Ultimate tensile strength (0.58 MPa, 0.87 MPa), elongation at failure (113.19\%, 62.81\%), and elastic modulus (1.83 MPa, 5.18 MPa) for porcine and human samples respectively exhibited significant differences based on species. Generally, human tissues were stronger and less compliant than their porcine counterparts. Furthermore, harvest site location and testing orientation significantly affected several mechanical properties in porcine derived tissues, but very few in human tissues. The data suggests that porcine colorectal tissue does not accurately model human colorectal tissue mechanical properties. Ultimately, the tensile properties reported herein may be used to help guide the design of next generation rectal catheters with tissue mimetic properties, as well as aid in the development of physical and computer based bowel models.},

The properties of PVA-clay nanocomposites were characterized by measuring the shear strength of wood block shear-type assemblies bonded with new formulated adhesives in dry and wet, and also, at elevated temperatures. Thermal stability and structure of the PVA-clay nanocomposites were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that shear strength of wood joints increased in all states by adding nano-clay to PVA. Inclusion of nano-clay improved the thermal stability of PVA to different degrees depending on nano-clay loading and type. The morphological studies revealed that the fluctuations observed in thermal stability and bond strength of the nanocomposites stem from dispersion quality of nano-clay.},

	isbn = {978-81-7833-009-9},
	abstract = {The Indian plastic and polymer industry has taken great strides. In the last few decades, the industry has grown to the status of a leading sector in the country with a sizable base. The material is gaining notable importance in different spheres of activity and the per capita consumption is increasing at a fast pace. Numerous plastics and fibers are produced from synthetic polymers; containers from propylene, coating materials from PVC, packaging film from polyethylene, experimental apparatus from Teflon, stockings from nylon fiber, there are too many to mention them all. The reason why plastics are popular is that they may offer such advantages as transparency, self lubrication, light weight, flexibility, economy in fabricating and decorating. Properties of plastics can be modified through the use of fillers, reinforcing agents and chemical additives. Silicones are by far the most important industrial polymers and are based on silicon, an element abundantly available on our planet. Polymers are classified in three broad groups; addition polymers, condensation polymers and special polymers. It is well known that the major consumption of additives is in PVC compounds. Approximately 80\% of additives are being used in PVC; however the left over 20\% is consumed in compounding of other thermoplastics. Plastic master batches and fillers have their own importance in plastic processing industries. Colorants are the materials that give colour and opacity to plastics are chemically characterized as either pigments or dyes. Pigments are finely pulverized natural or synthetic particles which may be of inorganic or organic origin and insoluble in the matrix in which they are dispersed. Permanent red 2B is a mono azo pigment that is widely used in thermoplastics because it is inexpensive and has high tinting strength and good bleed resistance. Fillers are commonly employed in opaque PVC compounds to reduce cost and to improve electrical insulation properties, to improve deformation resistance of cables, to increase the hardness of a flooring compound and to reduce tackiness of highly plasticized compounds. Various calcium carbonate are used for general purpose work, china clay is commonly employed for electrical insulation, and asbestos for flooring applications. Also employed occasionally are the silicas and silicates, talc, light magnesium carbonate and barites (barium sulfate). Polymer Energy system is an award winning, innovative, proprietary process to convert waste plastics into renewable energy. Polymers are the most rapidly growing sector of the materials industry. No wonder polymers are found in everything from compact discs to high tech aerospace applications. On the basis of value added, Indian share of plastic products industry is about 0.5\% of national GDP. Some of the astonishing fundamentals of the book are industrial polymers, addition polymers polyolefins, polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, cross linked polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high molecular weight polyethylene,  high density polyethylene, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), stabilizers, plasticizers, extenders, mineral filled or glass bead/milled glass grades, antistatic/electro conductive grades, electroplatable grades, etc. The present book enlightens the processing of industrial polymers, additives, colourant and fillers. This book is an invaluable resource to new entrepreneurs, technocrats, researchers, professionals etc.},

	isbn = {978-81-7833-111-9},
	abstract = {Adhesives were utilized in a sophisticated manner even in ancient times. Recent years have seen the rapid development of adhesive bonding as an economic and effective method for the fabrication of components and assemblies. The great many types of adhesives are currently in use and there is no adequate single system of classification for all products. The adhesives industry has generally employed classifications based on end use, such as metal to metal adhesives, wood adhesives, general purpose adhesives, paper and packaging adhesives etc. An adhesive or formulation is generally a mixture of several materials. The extent of mixture and the ratio usually depend upon the properties desired in the final bonded joint. The basic materials may be defined as those substances, which provide the necessary adhesive and binding properties. The type of adhesive material is easier to define and usually falls into three categories; thermosetting resins, thermoplastic resins and elastomeric resins. A thermosetting system, 100 percent reactive when in a pure state, the epoxies are very desirable and more widely used than any other chemical type. Epoxy is one of the newer types and has penetrated more fields of manufacturing operations in a shorter space of time than any of its predecessors. The many catalysts used with epoxies produce systems of variable properties. The most common are the aromatic amines and cyclic anhydrides. The phenolics or phenol formaldehyde resins are formed by the condensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde. The phenolic resins have been used extensively in the lamination of plywood and in filament wound structures. There are two basic classes of phenolic resins resoles and novalacs, and both begin as phenol alcohols. When combined or alloyed with other adhesive systems, they become excellent structural adhesives and are widely used in this manner throughout the aerospace industry. The vinyl polymers do not stand alone as a structural adhesive, but hundreds of adhesives are formulated by the use of this class of polymer. The vinyls are important to adhesive bonding not only from the adhesive standpoint, but because the films derived from these substances are widely used as vacuum bags, slip sheets, etc. The more widely used ones are polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl fluoride. There are numerous kinds of adhesives used in different industries; polyvinyl acetate wood adhesives, aminoresin wood adhesives, phenolic resin wood adhesives, cynoacrylate adhesives, hot melt adhesives, water based adhesives etc. The market for adhesives is comprised of thousands of end uses. The realm of market applications expands as new end uses keep developing, driven by the need for new and innovative attachment solutions. When looking at the total market, adhesives account for about 75\% of the volume consumed. This book basically deals with adhesive properties and general characteristics, adhesive materials and properties, adhesives types, thermoplastic adhesives, thermosetting adhesives, rubber resin blends, properties of basic adhesives types, acrylics acrylic acid diesters, allyl diglycol, carbonate, animal glues, blood albumen, butadiene styrene rubbers, butyl rubber and polyisobutylene casein, cellulose derivatives, cellulose acetate, acetate butyrate cellulose, caprate cellulose, nitrate (nitrocellulose or pyroxylin), ethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, ceramic or refractory inorganic adhesives cyanoacrylates, epoxy adhesives, epoxy nylon, epoxy polyamide, epoxy polysulphide, epoxy polyurethane, fish glue, furanes etc. The present book covers the manufacturing processes of different industrial adhesives with their formulae. It is hoped that the book can serve to new entrepreneurs, technocrats and existing units to the technology of adhesive and guide them to a useful understanding of the wide variety of adhesives which exist today.},

For each emulsion, the monomer composition and gel content were kept constant but different average particle sizes and distributions were used. Adhesive films 100 μm thick were then prepared from these emulsions and their rheological properties in the linear regime and adhesive properties were systematically characterized. Surprisingly, both the rheological and adhesive properties were found to be very dependent on the initial latex particle size distribution. A series of experiments were carried out to assess the adhesive properties of films made from blends of small- and large-particle-size latexes. Using the probe tack test, a maximum in adhesion energy of the dry films was found for 60\% of small particles in the blend, a composition clearly different from that giving a minimum viscosity of the latex implying that optimizing for properties may not be equivalent to optimizing for processing in these adhesive applications. Finally, the adhesive properties of two multimodal latexes with different particle size distributions were investigated. Both gave significantly higher adhesion energies and clear evidence of a fibrillar detachment process. This important result suggests that the spatial distribution of gel domains in the dry film and the molecular connectivity between those gel domains also play an important role in controlling its adhesive properties.},

	abstract = {In this investigation, the influence of different nanoparticles and surface roughness on the adhesion between epoxy adhesive and steel substrate was primarily investigated. The results of pull-off adhesion tests indicated that nano-Al2O3 of the three kinds of nanoparticles had the most influence on adhesion strength, which was the optimal additive for the epoxy adhesive to improve the adhesion strength. Also, it was found that modified by 2\% nano-Al2O3, the strength multiplication on the surface abraded with silicon carbide paper of 150 grits (150\#) was the highest, of three different surface roughness. So, as the results showed that modified by 2\% nano-Al2O3, the adhesion strength of epoxy adhesive on the surface abraded with 150\# was visibly improved by about 5 times. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) displayed nano-Al2O3 homogeneously dispersed in epoxy adhesive. Field emission scanning electronic microscope (FE-SEM) revealed that the surface morphology of steel well coincided with that of epoxy adhesive.},

	abstract = {The possible role of surface energy thermodynamics in mucoadhesion was investigated with Polycarbophil and pig intestinal mucosa. In separate experiments, the surface energy parameters of the substrate (mucosa) and the adhesive (polymer film) were determined by contact angle measurements on captive air/octane bubbles in three physiologically relevant test fluids (isotonic saline, artificial gastric fluid, and artificial intestinal fluid). Whereas the swollen Polycarbophil films were relatively hydrophilic as indicated by small water contact angles (22, 23, and 16°), the water contact angles measured on mucosal tissue were significantly larger (61, 48, and 57°). Hence, mucus was found to possess an appreciable hydrophobicity. The measured adhesive performance (force of detachment) between Polycarbophil and pig small intestinal mucosa was highest in non-buffered saline medium, intermediate in gastric fluid, and minimal in intestinal fluid. In agreement with this trend, the mismatch in surface polarities between substrate and adhesive, calculated from the contact angle data, increased in the same order.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the influence of silica as fillers on polymer interdiffusion in poly(butyl methacrylate) latex films. We carry out fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements on latex films that allow us to follow the extent of polymer diffusion as a function of time after the latex/pigment dispersion dries. In this study, we compare four different types of colloidal silica and discuss how fillers affect the rate of polymer interdiffusion in latex films. The efficiency of energy transfer data for newly formed films indicate that 54 and 73 nm diameter SiO2 particles have little or no effect on the interfacial area between donor- and acceptor-labeled latex cells, whereas the 16 and 27 nm SiO2 particles significantly reduce the interfacial area with increasing amounts of filler. The maximum efficiency of energy transfer data indicate that 16 and 27 nm SiO2 also affect the extent of mixing that can be achieved in 200 h annealing at 60 °C. The rate of polymer interdiffusion in latex films is retarded as one increases the amount of filler, and this rate decreases as the filler size decreases. Our results can be explained with a free volume model that assumes that the surface of the silica particles raises the effective glass transition temperature of the matrix.},

	abstract = {The effect of phase-pure cristobalite (a high temperature crystalline polymorph of silica) on the adhesive characteristics of hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was studied. The potential advantages of PDMS/cristobalite composite system as an adhesive for aerospace applications are also discussed. A PDMS/cristobalite composite adhesive system containing different filler contents (0–46 volume percentage, vol\%) was prepared. The filler material, phase-pure cristobalite, was synthesized by the pyrolysis of fused silica at 1400°C. The mechanical, rheological, and thermal characteristics of the composites were studied. A high yield stress (0.151 Pa), shear-thinning index (1.051), and fast recovery rate were observed for ∼34 vol\% cristobalite loading, which indicate that PDMS retains its excellent adhesive and flow characteristics even at high filler loading with enhanced mechanical characteristics. Thermal analysis shows the onset of degradation of PDMS shifts to higher temperatures, 372–438°C and 317–417°C in nitrogen and air atmosphere respectively, which shows excellent thermal stability. The residual component yields after thermal degradation of PDMS/cristobalite composite system in nitrogen and air atmosphere show different degradation mechanisms.

Surface roughness and surface free energy (SFE) characteristics were measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy and the sessile drop method. Shear bond strength and bond failure interface were analyzed to compare the physical properties. Antimicrobial activities were analyzed by a bacterial adhesion assay, a disk diffusion test, and an optical density measurement of bacterial suspension containing each adhesive. ECAs had rougher surfaces than conventional adhesives due to the addition of silver nanoparticles. ECAs had more similar SFE characteristics to composite than to RMGI. Bacterial adhesion to ECAs was less than to conventional adhesives, which was not influenced by saliva coating. Bacterial suspension containing ECAs showed slower bacterial growth than those containing conventional adhesives. There was no significant difference in shear bond strength and bond failure interface between ECAs and conventional adhesives. This study suggests that ECAs can help prevent enamel demineralization around their surfaces without compromising physical properties.},

	abstract = {Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) that can be injected to form a scaffold in situ has promise for the repair of bone defects. However, its low-strength limits the CPC to non-stress-bearing repairs. Fibrin glue (FG) with good sticking property and biocompatibility is possible used to reinforce the CPC. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of FG on the mechanical and biological properties of CPC in an injectable CPC-FG composite. The initial setting time of this CPC-FG was delayed compared with the CPC control at different powder/liquid (P/L) mass ratio (p {\textgreater} 0.05). At a P/L of 5, the strength was (38.41 ± 4.32) MPa for the CPC-FG, much higher than (27.42 ± 2.85) MPa for the CPC alone (p {\textless} 0.05). SEM showed bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with healthy spreading and anchored on the CPC-FG composite. After 14 days, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was (538 ± 33) for the BMSCs on the CPC-FG and (517 ± 27) for the BMSCs on the CPC alone. Both ALPs were higher than the baseline ALP (93 ± 10) for the undifferentiated BMSCs (p {\textless} 0.05). The results demonstrate that this stronger CPC-FG scaffold may be useful for stem cell-based bone regeneration in moderate load-bearing orthopedic applications. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present study investigates how such easy-to-apply polymers may be used on a much broader range of applications, particularly for gluing wet bone. We investigate the significantly improved adhesion of the polymer to wet bone surfaces in a close to in vivo setup using freshly cut cow hip bone as a model. The use of a reactive filler (20wt.\% amorphous, glassy calcium phosphate nanoparticles, a-CaP) allows for combination of the properties of the polymer (strength; light-curing) and the reactive filler (recrystallization of amorphous CaP to hydroxyapatite within minutes). This filler alone has been earlier suggested for use as an injectable bone cement since it reacts under in vivo conditions within 10–15min. Our study transfers this reactivity into a composite, thus using the reactive CaP phase to establish an improved adhesion of the composite to wet bone surfaces. Additional in vitro bioactivity tests, compressive and tensile strength suggest use of such light-curable nanocomposites for complex-shaped load-bearing implant materials and fracture repair.},

	abstract = {Background
Intra-abdominal adhesions arise after more than 50\% of all abdominal operations and are an important source of postoperative complications. They attach normally separated organs to each other and can cause major problems for the affected patients by giving rise to small bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, infertility, and higher complication rates in subsequent operations. They are also a frequent source of medicolegal conflict. Thus, every physician should be familiar with their mechanism of origin, their consequences, and the methods by which they can be prevented.

Methods
A selective PubMed/Medline search from 1960 onward as well as articles to which these publications referred. The expert consensus position of the European Society for Gynaecological Surgery is also taken into consideration.

Results
Adhesions arise through aberrant wound healing after peritoneal injury with further influence from a variety of other factors. Preventive measures include minimizing peritoneal injury intraoperatively through the meticulous observance of basic surgical principles, moistening the mesothelium to keep it from drying out, irrigating the peritoneal cavity to remove blood and clot, and keeping the use of intra-abdominal foreign material to a minimum.

Conclusion
Adhesions are an inevitable consequence of intra-abdominal surgery. They can be prevented to some extent with meticulous surgical technique and certain other measures. For operations carrying a high risk of postoperative adhesions, e.g., surgery on the adnexa or 
bowel, commercially available peritoneal instillates or barrier methods can be used to limit adhesion formation.},

Although a good surgical technique is a crucial part of adhesion prevention, the technique alone cannot effectively eliminate the adhesions. Thus, there remains a room for further research. A comprehensive literature review of published experimental and clinical studies of adhesion prevention was carried out at the University of Bristol electronic library (MetaLib) with cross-search of seven different medical databases (AMED-Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, BIOSIS Previews on Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, Embase and Medline on Web of Knowledge, OvidSP and PubMed) by using key words (peritoneal adhesions, postoperative adhesions, prevention) to explore the progress in different surgical strategies and adjuvant materials used to prevent adhesions formation and reformation.

	abstract = {Peritoneal adhesions represent an important clinical challenge in gastrointestinal surgery. Peritoneal adhesions are a consequence of peritoneal irritation by infection or surgical trauma, and may be considered as the pathological part of healing following any peritoneal injury, particularly due to abdominal surgery. The balance between fibrin deposition and degradation is critical in determining normal peritoneal healing or adhesion formation. Postoperative peritoneal adhesions are a major cause of morbidity resulting in multiple complications, many of which may manifest several years after the initial surgical procedure. In addition to acute small bowel obstruction, peritoneal adhesions may cause pelvic or abdominal pain, and infertility. In this paper, the authors reviewed the epidemiology, pathogenesis and various prevention strategies of adhesion formation, using Medline and PubMed search. Several preventive agents against postoperative peritoneal adhesions have been investigated. Their role aims in activating fibrinolysis, hampering coagulation, diminishing the inflammatory response, inhibiting collagen synthesis or creating a barrier between adjacent wound surfaces. Their results are encouraging but most of them are contradictory and achieved mostly in animal model. Until additional findings from future clinical researches, only a meticulous surgery can be recommended to reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality rates from these untoward effects of surgery. In the current state of knowledge, pre-clinical or clinical studies are still necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the several proposed prevention strategies of postoperative peritoneal adhesions.},

	abstract = {The passive monitoring of biological environments by soft materials has a variety of nanobiotechnology applications; however, invoking distinct transitions in geometric, mechanical or optical properties remains a prevalent design challenge. We demonstrate here that close-packed nanoparticle–hydrogel composites can progress through a substantial shift in such properties by the use of a chemical-to-physical cross-link transition mediated by the catalytic activity of different proteases. Catalytic cleavage of the original hydrogel network structure initiates the self-assembled formation of a secondary, physically cross-linked network, causing a 1200\% increase in storage modulus. Furthermore, this unique mechanism can be fabricated as a 3D photonic crystal with broad (∼240 nm), visible responses to the targeted enzymes. Moreover, the material provided threshold responses, requiring a certain extent of proteolytic activity before the transition occurred. This allowed for the fabrication of Boolean logic gates (OR and AND), which responded to a specific assortment of proteases. Ultimately, this mechanism enables the design of stimuli-responsive hydrogels, which can proceed through a secondary network formation, after an energetic barrier has been breached. Protease responsive hydrogel nanocomposites, described here, could offer avenues in degradation-stiffening and collapsing materials for a variety of biomaterial applications.},

	abstract = {Polymer nanomaterials have sparked a considerable interest as vehicles used for diagnostic and therapeutic agents; research in nanomedicine has not only become a frontier movement but is also a revolutionizing drug delivery field. A common approach for building a drug delivery system is to incorporate the drug within the nanocarrier that results in increased solubility, metabolic stability, and improved circulation time. With this foundation, nanoparticles with stealth properties that can circumvent RES and other clearance and defense mechanisms are the most promising. However, recent developments indicate that select polymer nanomaterials can implement more than only inert carrier functions by being biological response modifiers. One representative of such materials is Pluronic block copolymers that cause various functional alterations in cells. The key attribute for the biological activity of Pluronics is their ability to incorporate into membranes followed by subsequent translocation into the cells and affecting various cellular functions, such as mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, activity of drug efflux transporters, apoptotic signal transduction, and gene expression. As a result, Pluronics cause drastic sensitization of MDR tumors to various anticancer agents, enhance drug transport across the blood brain and intestinal barriers, and causes transcriptional activation of gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these studies suggest that Pluronics have a broad spectrum of biological response modifying activities which make it one of the most potent drug targeting systems available, resulting in a remarkable impact on the emergent field of nanomedicine.},

At low temperatures and/or concentrations the PEOPPOPEO copolymers exist in solution as individual coils (unimers). Thermodynamically stable micelles are formed with increasing copolymer concentration and/or solution temperature, as revealed by surface tension, light scattering, and dye solubilization experiments. The unimer-to-micelle transition is not sharp, but spans a concentration decade or 10 K. The critical micellization concentration (CMC) and temperature (CMT) decrease with an increase in the copolymer PPO content or molecular weight. The dependence of CMC on temperature, together with differential scanning calorimetry experiments, indicates that the micellization process of PEOPPOPEO copolymers in water is endothermic and driven by a decrease in the polarity of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) segments as the temperature increases, and by the entropy gain in water when unimers aggregate to form micelles (hydrophobic effect). The free energy and enthalpy of micellization can be correlated to the total number of EO and PO segments in the copolymer and its molecular weight. The micelles have hydrodynamic radii of approximately 10 nm and aggregation numbers in the order of 50. The aggregation number is thought to be independent of the copolymer concentration and to increase with temperature. Phenomenological and mean-field lattice models for the formation of micelles can describe qualitatively the trends observed experimentally. In addition, the lattice models can provide information on the distribution of the EO and PO segments in the micelle. The PEOPPOPEO copolymers adsorb on both airwater and solidwater interfaces; the PPO block is located at the interface while the PEO block extends into the solution, when copolymers are adsorbed at hydrophobic interfaces. Gels are formed by certain PEOPPOPEO block copolymers at high concentrations, with the micelles remaining apparently intact in the form of a “crystal”. The gelation onset temperature and the thermal stability range of the gel increase with increasing PEO block length. A comparison of PEOPPO copolymers with PEOPBO and PEO PS block copolymers and CiEj surfactants is made, and selected applications of PEOPPOPEO block copolymer solutions (such as solubilization of organics, protection of microorganisms, and biomedical uses of micelles and gels) are presented.},

The goal of this study was to determine if methylene blue, a highly redox active dye that has been shown to inhibit adhesion formation (1) acts as an antioxidant in the postoperative peritoneum, and (2) subsequently affects fibrinolytic activity. Intraabdominal adhesions were surgically induced in rats receiving methylene blue (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (sterile water) intraperitoneally at surgery. At 24 h and 7 d following surgery, adhesion formation, oxidative stress, and peritoneal fibrinolytic activity were assessed. Methylene blue did not affect adhesion formation at 24 h, but did induce a {\textgreater}50\% regression in adhesions after 7 d (P {\textless} 0.05). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and 8-isoprostane and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were all significantly increased in peritoneal tissue samples (P {\textless} 0.05) by 24 h following surgery. Methylene blue inhibited NADPH oxidase by 98\% and MPO activity by 78\% in the 24 h tissue samples, and blunted the corresponding surgery-induced increases in tissue lipid and protein oxidation. Furthermore, methylene blue significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.05) fibrinolytic activity in peritoneal fluid at 24 h. Methylene blue acts as an antioxidant in this experimental system and may reduce intraabdominal adhesion formation by enhancing peritoneal fibrinolytic activity following surgery.},

This study investigated the expression of TGF-b1 in peritoneal tissue, and possible correlation with components of the fibrinolytic system locally in peritoneal tissue. Materials and methods. Peritoneal samples were taken from 22 patients at relaparotomy. Samples of adhesions were collected from 10 patients. The patients were categorized into different groups depending on the quantity and the quality of adhesions. TGF-β1 and components of the fibrinolytic system in tissue extracts were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results. The concentration of active TGF-β1 in peritoneal samples from patients with extensive adhesions was double (P {\textless}.01) that of healthy subjects, but the total levels of TGF-β1 were similar (P =.63). In adhesion tissue, both active (P {\textless}.003) and total (P {\textless}.008) TGF-β1 concentrations were more than twice as high as unaffected peritoneum. There was a significant correlation between the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in peritoneal samples with active TGF-β1 (P {\textless}.03, r = 0.693) and adhesion tissue with total TGF-β1 (P =.001, r = 0.872). The other components of the fibrinolytic system did not correlate significantly with TGF-β1. Conclusions. These data indicate that an overexpression of TGF-β1 is associated with adhesion formation, possibly through a mechanism involving local regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.

A total of 339 subjects (mean age, 67 years) who underwent lung biopsy of indeterminate masses, without immediate postsample CT evidence of a pneumothorax, were randomized at 15 U.S. centers. Treatment subjects (n = 170) received a plug deployed through the coaxial needle just before the needle was removed. Control subjects (n = 169) did not receive a plug. The primary end point was defined as the absence of pneumothorax on chest radiographs at all three required postprocedure assessments (30- to 60-minute, 24-hour, 30-day); analysis was stratified by any smoking history and study site. A central laboratory performed blinded independent interpretation of the radiographs. Among the 287 subjects who completed all postprocedure assessments, significantly more treatment subjects than control subjects achieved the primary end point (127 of 150, 85\% vs 95 of 137, 69\%; P = .002). Among all 339 randomized subjects, the odds of achieving the primary end point were 4.4 times greater for nonsmokers than they were for smokers (95\% confidence interval, 1.7, 11.0; P = 0.002); study site had no statistically significant effect. Compared with control subjects, treatment subjects had fewer pneumothoraces (30 of 170, 18\% vs 53 of 169, 31\%), fewer chest tubes placed (6 of 170, 4\% vs 18 of 169, 11\%), and fewer postbiopsy hospital admissions (16 of 170, 9\% vs 23 of 169, 14\%). The lung biopsy tract plug significantly reduced rates of pneumothorax in patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsy. Rates of chest tube placement and postprocedure hospital admission were also reduced.},

This retrospective analysis included biopsies of lung lesions from 200 consecutive patients. The first 100 consecutive biopsies made up the control group, in which no plug intervention was used. The next 100 consecutive biopsies made up the treatment group, in which a hydrogel plug was deployed through a 19-G coaxial needle system after 20-G core samples were obtained. The overall mean age was 64.92 years. No statistically significant differences in patient characteristics and procedure parameters were found between the control and treatment groups except for age (mean age, 62.92 vs. 66.92 y, P=0.022) and procedure duration (mean minutes, 7.81 vs. 6.47 min, P=0.021). The rate of pneumothorax in the control versus treatment group was 31\% vs. 29\% (P=0.498) and the rate of hemoptysis was 6\% vs. 3\% (P=0.354). The rate of chest tube insertion after pneumothorax was significantly higher in the control group than in the treatment group (10\% vs. 2\%, P=0.032) and the average length of hospital stay was longer in the control group (0.44 vs. 0.07 d, P=0.041). The difference was still statistically significant for the chest tube insertion rate (P=0.030) and close to statistically significant for the length of hospital stay (P=0.063), after adjusting for the confounding effect of age and procedure duration. These data show that the deployment of a hydrogel plug after a computed tomography–guided lung biopsy significantly reduced the rate of chest tube insertion along with a reduced length of hospital stay.},

This method is based on fundamental insights, theoretical models, and empirical studies. We then discuss the unique bundled morphology and mechanical properties of fiber mats produced by SBS, and how they compare with electrospun fiber mats. Applications of SBS in biomedical engineering are highlighted, showing enhanced cell infiltration and proliferation versus electrospun fiber scaffolds and in situ deposition of biodegradable polymers. We also discuss the impact of SBS in applications involving textiles and electronics, including ceramic fibers and conductive composite materials. Strategies for future research are presented that take advantage of direct and rapid polymer deposition via cost-effective methods.},

This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of solution blow spun polymer (BSP) for sealing bowel perforations in a mouse model of partial cecal transection. We then evaluated its use for reinforcing a surgical anastomosis in a preclinical piglet model. Three commercially available surgical sealants (fibrin glue, polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel, and cyanoacrylate) were compared to BSP in the ability to seal partially transected cecum in mice. For anastomosis feasibility testing in a piglet model, piglets were subjected to small bowel transection with sutured anastomosis reinforced with BSP application. Outcome measures included anastomotic burst pressure, anastomotic leak rate, 14-day survival, and complication rate. For the mouse model, the survival rates for the sealants were 30\% for fibrin glue, 20\% for PEG hydrogel, 78\% for cyanoacrylate, and 67\% for BSP. Three of 9 mice died after BSP administration because of perforation leak, failure to thrive with partial obstruction at the perforation site, and unknown causes. All other mice died of perforation leak. The mean burst pressure at 24h was significantly higher for BSP (81mm Hg) when compared to fibrin glue (6mm Hg, p=0.047) or PEG hydrogel (10mm Hg, p=0.047), and comparable to cyanoacrylate (64mm Hg, p=0.91). For piglets, 4 of 4 animals survived at 14days. Mean burst pressures at time of surgery were 37±5mm Hg for BSP and 11±9mm Hg for suture-only controls (p=0.09). Solution blow spinning may be an effective technique as an adjunct for sealing of gastrointestinal anastomosis. Further preclinical testing is warranted to better understand BSP properties and alternative surgical applications.},

	abstract = {Stopping blood in its tracks
Effective treatments for ruptured blood vessels must be rapidly deployed to promote hemostasis. Avery et al. formulated a gelatin and silicate nanoplatelet hydrogel material that occluded blood flow without requiring thrombus formation. When injected into arteries and veins in mice and pigs, the biomaterial occluded blood flow without evidence of fragmentation or displacement for up to 24 days. Occluded vessels showed evidence of connective tissue replacing the biomaterial in the vessel lumen. Shear-thinning biomaterials represent promising alternatives for stable endovascular embolization.
Improved endovascular embolization of vascular conditions can generate better patient outcomes and minimize the need for repeat procedures. However, many embolic materials, such as metallic coils or liquid embolic agents, are associated with limitations and complications such as breakthrough bleeding, coil migration, coil compaction, recanalization, adhesion of the catheter to the embolic agent, or toxicity. Here, we engineered a shear-thinning biomaterial (STB), a nanocomposite hydrogel containing gelatin and silicate nanoplatelets, to function as an embolic agent for endovascular embolization procedures. STBs are injectable through clinical catheters and needles and have hemostatic activity comparable to metallic coils, the current gold standard. In addition, STBs withstand physiological pressures without fragmentation or displacement in elastomeric channels in vitro and in explant vessels ex vivo. In vitro experiments also indicated that STB embolization did not rely on intrinsic thrombosis as coils did for occlusion, suggesting that the biomaterial may be suitable for use in patients on anticoagulation therapy or those with coagulopathy. Using computed tomography imaging, the biomaterial was shown to fully occlude murine and porcine vasculature in vivo and remain at the site of injection without fragmentation or nontarget embolization. Given the advantages of rapid delivery, in vivo stability, and independent occlusion that does not rely on intrinsic thrombosis, STBs offer an alternative gel-based embolic agent with translational potential for endovascular embolization.
An engineered shear-thinning biomaterial is used as an embolic agent for vascular occlusion as treatment for bleeding.

	abstract = {Applying 3D direct laser writing, artificial hierarchical gecko-type structures are designed and fabricated down to nanometer dimensions. In this way, the elastic modulus and the length scale of the gecko's setae are very closely matched. Direct laser writing is a very flexible rapid prototyping method allowing the fabrication of arbitrary nanostructures. Since the parameters of the structures can be easily changed, this technique is perfect for design studies of dry adhesives. Measuring the adhesional forces by atomic force microscopy, the influence of several design parameters like density, aspect ratio, and tip-shape on dry adhesion performance are systematically examined. In this way, it is revealed that hierarchy is favorable for artificial gecko-inspired dry adhesives made of stiff materials on the nanometer scale.},

In recent years, nanoparticles (NPs) have increasingly found practical applications in technology, research and medicine. The small particle size coupled to their unique chemical and physical properties is thought to underlie their exploitable biomedical activities. Here, we review current toxicity studies of NPs with clinical potential. Mechanisms of cytotoxicity are discussed and the problem of extrapolating knowledge gained from cell-based studies into a human scenario is highlighted. The so-called ‘proof-of-principle’ approach, whereby ultra-high NP concentrations are used to ensure cytotoxicity, is evaluated on the basis of two considerations; firstly, from a scientific perspective, the concentrations used are in no way related to the actual doses required which, in many instances, discourages further vital investigations. Secondly, these inaccurate results cast doubt on the science of nanomedicine and thus, quite dangerously, encourage unnecessary alarm in the public. In this context, the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results are described along with the need for a unifying protocol for reliable and realistic toxicity reports.},

	abstract = {Occupational exposure to mineral dusts, such as silica, has been associated with progressive pulmonary inflammation, lung cancer, and fibrosis. However, the mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. Because p53 is a key transcription factor regulating many important apoptosis-related genes, we hypothesized that p53 may play a key role in silica-induced apoptosis and that abnormal regulation of p53 by silica may contribute to development of lung cancer as well as silicosis. We used both in vitro and in vivo studies to test this hypothesis. Treatment of JB6 cells carrying a p53-luciferase reporter plasmid with silica caused dose-dependent p53 transactivation. Western blot indicates that silica not only stimulated p53 protein expression but also caused p53 phosphorylation at Ser392. TUNEL and DNA fragmentation analysis show that silica caused apoptosis in both JB6 cells and wild-type p53 (p53+/+) fibroblasts but not in p53-deficient (p53-/-) fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained by in vivo studies. Intratracheal instillation of mice with silica induced apoptosis in the lung of p53+/+ mice, whereas this induction was significantly inhibited in p53-/- mice. Confocal image analysis indicates that most apoptotic cells induced by silica were alveolar macrophages. These results demonstrate for the first time that silica induces p53 transactivation via induction of p53 protein expression and phosphorylation of p53 protein and that p53 plays a crucial role in the signal transduction pathways of silica-induced apoptosis. This finding may provide an important link in understanding the molecular mechanisms of silica-induced carcinogenesis and pathogenesis in the lung.},

	abstract = {The present study was designed to examine the uptake, localization, and the cytotoxic effects of well-dispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles in mouse keratinocytes (HEL-30). Mouse keratinocytes were exposed for 24 h to various concentrations of amorphous silica nanoparticles in homogeneous suspensions of average size distribution (30, 48, 118, and 535 nm SiO2) and then assessed for uptake and biochemical changes. Results of transmission electron microscopy revealed all sizes of silica were taken up into the cells and localized into the cytoplasm. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay shows LDH leakage was dose- and size-dependent with exposure to 30 and 48 nm nanoparticles. However, no LDH leakage was observed for either 118 or 535 nm nanoparticles. The mitochondrial viability assay (MTT) showed significant toxicity for 30 and 48 nm at high concentrations (100 μg/mL) compared to the 118 and 535 nm particles. Further studies were carried out to investigate if cellular reduced GSH and mitochondria membrane potential are involved in the mechanism of SiO2 toxicity. The redox potential of cells (GSH) was reduced significantly at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL at 30 nm nanoparticle exposures. However, silica nanoparticles larger than 30 nm showed no changes in GSH levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation did not show any significant change between controls and the exposed cells. In summary, amorphous silica nanoparticles below 100 nm induced cytotoxicity suggest size of the particles is critical to produce biological effects.},

	abstract = {Because vascular and cardic surgery exists, surgeons have faced technical difficulties mainly owing to the poor quality of the tissues, the unsafe sutures, and the possibility of catastrophic consequent hemorrhages. As a measure to reduce those deleterious difficulties, surgeons have imagined and developed a great number of technical artifacts and procedures. Among these, the idea of using adhesives and sealants appeared in the 1950s and rapidly resulted in numerous experimental studies These ideas stemmed from three main reasons: 1The potential rapidity of performing surgical repairs;2The possibility of immediately obtaining a tight and solid repair;3The possibility of reinforcing weak or torn tissues in order to perform safe sutures. To be used in a biological environment, an adhesive substance may comply to some conditions. These conditions and the required properties of biological surgical sealants were precisely defined and described in 1968 by Cooper and Falb in their report to the New York Academy of Sciences on surgical adhesives. A surgical adhesive must bond rapidly to the surrounding living tissues and keep its adhesive power. Although the main accepted mechanisms of adhesion based on physico-chemical aspects of molecular forces may apply, the nearly permanent presence of water or aqueous fluids in a biological environment may prevent the normal interplay of these forces at appropriate interfaces. The bonding forces, indeed, must not be reduced by the presence of water. Therefore, the substance must be insoluble or extremely slowly soluble in body fluids. It must, if possible, preserve the suppleness of the tissues. Lastly, it must not prove locally irritative or generally toxic, immediately or in the long term. Four different types of bonds are generally considered as being responsible for solid adhesion of sealants. They are the electro-static, covalent, metallic, or chemical (primary) bonds, and the residual or physical (secondary) bonds. Because of the high polarity of biological tissue surfaces, secondary forces might be an important factor in adhesion in surgical or biological use. But those forces are not strong enough to resist the hydrogen bonding of water (about 5 kcal/mol). The water, therefore, penetrates the interface and weakens the adhesion. Therefore, it is important to use substances that develope primary bonds with the biological tissues. A certain number of reactive groups have been identified in the tissues. Inside collagen, for instance, the amine, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups represent about 25\% of the amino-acid components. A great number of functions are able to react with these groups. The selection of an adhesive system that can be used in surgery must take into account the presence of one of those groups. Additionally, many practical conditions must be taken into consideration. The adhesive agent must be easy to use, supplied in a small quantity, and easily storable. When applied, it must remain fluid but must lead to a rapid and efficacious adhesion. Because the application of heat and high pressure is not possible in a biological environment, the means of solidification of the adhesive agent are limited to rapid polymerisation of monomers, use of active prepolymers, absorption of a solvent, and solidification of a polymer emulsion under the action of a moderate pressure or a hydrogen ion concentration (pH) modification.20 A great variety of products thought to correspond to those conditions have been tested. Among those, polyacrylates, rubber latex, epoxy resins, formaldehyde resins, acetate and alcoholic polyvinyls, carboxylic polymers, etc., have demonstrated a more or less adhesive power. But none of them has demonstrated the necessary qualities to be used in a biological environment.},

AIM OF STUDY: This systematic review summarizes published clinical data for fibrin sealant use in cardiovascular surgery.
METHODS: A literature search for the following terms was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE: (TISSEEL or Tissucol or Beriplast P or Evicel or Quixil or Crosseal or Reliseal or Fibringluraas or Bolheal or Tachosil or Vivostat or Vitagel or Artiss or "fibrin glue" or "fibrin sealant" or "fibrin tissue adhesive") and (cardiac or cardiovascular or vascular or heart or coronary or surgery). Case reports and series were excluded; although reports of controlled trials were preferred, uncontrolled trial data were also considered.
RESULTS: Clinical trials and chart review analyses of fibrin sealants were identified and summarized. Although clinical trial data were available for other agents, the majority of published studies examined TISSEEL. Overall, TISSEEL and other fibrin sealants showed improvements over standard of care or control groups for a variety of predefined endpoints. Safety findings are also summarized.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from these studies showed that fibrin sealants were well tolerated and provided effective hemostasis in a range of cardiac and aortic surgeries.},

Bile leakage, bleeding, and abscess formation are major resection surface-related complications after liver resection. It is unclear whether application of fibrin sealant to the resection surface is effective in reducing these complications. In a multicenter, randomized trial in 310 noncirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection, we compared prophylactic application of fibrin sealant to the resection surface (156 patients) with no application of fibrin sealant (154 patients). In addition to clinical assessments, patients underwent protocolized computerized tomography (CT) scan 1 week postoperatively. Primary endpoint was a composite of postoperative resection surface-related complications (bile leakage, bleeding, or abscess), as adjudicated by a clinical-events committee that was unaware of the study-group assignments. Overall rate of resection surface-related complications was not different between the 2 groups: 24\% (38/156 patients) in the fibrin sealant group and 24\% (37/154 patients) in the control group. Bile leakage was detected in 14\% of patients in the fibrin sealant group and in 14\% of controls. CT scans showed a fluid collection at the resection surface 100 mL or more in 28\% of patients in the fibrin sealant group and in 26\% of controls (P = 0.800). The rate of reinterventions for resection surface-related complications (12\% vs 10\%; P = 0.492) and severity of complications did also not differ between the 2 groups. This randomized multicenter trial shows that prophylactic application of fibrin sealant at the resection surface after liver resections does not lead to a reduction in the incidence or severity of postoperative bile leakage or other resection surface-related complications (Controlled trial number, ISRCTN85205641).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants are widely used in liver surgery. The aim of this article is to review the literature on evidence of hemostatic and biliostatic capacities of different fibrin sealants in liver surgery.
METHODS: In PubMed, a literature search was done with the search terms 'fibrin sealant' or 'fibrin glue' combined with 'liver resection' or 'bile leakage'. Thirteen comparative fibrin sealant studies were selected.
RESULTS: In general, these studies have shown a reduced time to hemostasis when fibrin sealants were used. So far, only a few studies have been published that have focused on postoperative resection surface-related complications. There is no strong evidence that fibrin sealants reduce the incidence of bile leakage after liver resection. Important new evidence shows that bile contains profibrinolytic activity that causes lysis of the clot formed by the fibrin sealant at least in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrin sealants can be effective as an adjunct to achieve hemostasis during liver resections. However, considering lack of evidence on the efficacy of fibrin sealants in reducing postoperative resection surface-related complications, routine use of fibrin sealants in liver surgery cannot be recommended.},

The enhancement of polymer properties by the addition of inorganic nanoparticles is a complex function of interfacial interactions, interfacial area and the distribution of inter-nanofiller distances. The latter two factors depend on nanofiller dispersion, making it difficult to develop a fundamental understanding of their effects on nanocomposite properties. Here, we design model poly(methyl methacrylate)–silica and poly(2-vinyl pyridine)–silica nanocomposites consisting of polymer films confined between silica slides. We compare the dependence of the glass-transition temperature (Tg) and physical ageing on the interlayer distance in model nanocomposites with the dependence of silica nanoparticle content in real nanocomposites. We show that model nanocomposites provide a simple way to gain insight into the effect of interparticle spacing on Tg and to predict the approximate ageing response of real nanocomposites.},

	abstract = {The effects of confinement on glass transition temperature (Tg) and physical aging are measured in polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP) nanocomposites containing 10- to 15-nm-diameter silica nanospheres or 47-nm-diameter alumina nanospheres. Nanocomposites are made by spin coating films from sonicated solutions of polymer, nanofiller, and dye. The Tgs and physical aging rates are measured by fluorescence of trace levels of dye in the films. At 0.1–10 vol \% nanofiller, Tg values can be enhanced or depressed relative to neat, bulk Tg (Tg,bulk) or invariant with nanofiller content. For alumina nanocomposites, Tg increases relative to Tg,bulk by as much as 16 K in P2VP, decreases by as much as 5 K in PMMA, and is invariant in PS. By analogy with thin polymer films, these results are explained by wetted P2VP–nanofiller interfaces with attractive interactions, nonwetted PMMA–nanofiller interfaces (free space at the interface), and wetted PS–nanofiller interfaces lacking attractive interactions, respectively. The presence of wetted or nonwetted interfaces is controlled by choice of solvent. For example, 0.1–0.6 vol \% silica/PMMA nanocomposites exhibit Tg enhancements as large as 5 K or Tg reductions as large as 17 K relative to Tg,bulk when films are made from methyl ethyl ketone or acetic acid solutions, respectively. A factor of 17 reduction of physical aging rate relative to that of neat, bulk P2VP is demonstrated in a 4 vol \% alumina/P2VP nanocomposite. This suggests that a strategy for achieving nonequilibrium, glassy polymeric systems that are stable or nearly stable to physical aging is to incorporate well-dispersed nanoparticles possessing attractive interfacial interactions with the polymer. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In this article, the effects of size and confinement at the nanometre size scale on both the melting temperature, T m , and the glass transition temperature, T g , are reviewed. Although there is an accepted thermodynamic model (the Gibbs–Thomson equation) for explaining the shift in the first-order transition, T m , for confined materials, the depression of the melting point is still not fully understood and clearly requires further investigation. However, the main thrust of the work is a review of the field of confinement and size effects on the glass transition temperature. We present in detail the dynamic, thermodynamic and pseudo-thermodynamic measurements reported for the glass transition in confined geometries for both small molecules confined in nanopores and for ultrathin polymer films. We survey the observations that show that the glass transition temperature decreases, increases, remains the same or even disappears depending upon details of the experimental (or molecular simulation) conditions. Indeed, different behaviours have been observed for the same material depending on the experimental methods used. It seems that the existing theories of T g are unable to explain the range of behaviours seen at the nanometre size scale, in part because the glass transition phenomenon itself is not fully understood. Importantly, here we conclude that the vast majority of the experiments have been carried out carefully and the results are reproducible. What is currently lacking appears to be an overall view, which accounts for the range of observations. The field seems to be experimentally and empirically driven rather than responding to major theoretical developments.},

	abstract = {The static and dynamic properties of poly(2-vinylpyridine)/silica nanocomposites are investigated by temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry, broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transmission electron microscopy. Both BDS and SAXS detect the existence of an interfacial polymer layer on the surface of nanoparticles. The results show that whereas the calorimetric glass transition temperature varies only weakly with nanoparticle loading, the segmental mobility of the polymer interfacial layer is slower than the bulk polymer by 2 orders of magnitude. Detailed analysis of BDS and SAXS data reveal that the interfacial layer has a thickness of 4–6 nm irrespective of the nanoparticle concentration. These results demonstrate that in contrast to some recent articles on polymer nanocomposites, the interfacial polymer layer is by no means a “dead layer”. However, its existence might provide some explanation for controversies surrounding the dynamics of polymer nanocomposites.},

	abstract = {Blood coagulates faster upon contact with polar glasslike surfaces than on nonpolar plastic surfaces; this phenomenon is commonly termed the glass effect. However, the variable hemostatic response that we report here for contact-activated coagulation by different metal oxides, all of which are polar substrates, requires a refinement of this simple polarity model of how inorganic metal oxides activate the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. To our knowledge, the role of metal oxide surface charge as determined at the physiological pH and Ca2+ concentration of blood has not been previously investigated. We find that basic oxides with an isoelectric point above the pH of blood are anticoagulant while acidic oxides with an isoelectric point below the pH of blood are procoagulant. Using a thromboelastograph, we find that the onset time for coagulation and rate of coagulation post-initiation depend on both the sign and the magnitude of the initial surface charge density of the metal oxide. This work presents a useful strategy based on a quantifiable material parameter to select metal oxides to elicit a predictable and tunable biological response when they are in contact with blood.},

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have been investigated for virtually every organ system in the human body, and progress is made possible by advances in materials science, polymer chemistry, and molecular biology. This book reviews the current status of biomaterials for regenerative medicine, and highlights advances in both basic science and clinical practice. The latest methods for regulating the biological and chemical composition of biomaterials are described, together with techniques for modulating mechanical properties of engineered constructs. Contributors delineate methods for guiding the host response to implantable materials, and explain the use of biologically-inspired materials for optimal biological functionality and compatibility. The book culminates in a discussion of the clinical applications of regenerative medicine. By integrating engineering and clinical medicine, Engineering Biomaterials for Regenerative Medicine examines how tissue engineering and regenerative medicine can be translated into successful therapies to bridge the gap between laboratory and clinic. The book will aid materials scientists and engineers in identifying research priorities to fulfill clinical needs, and will also enable physicians to understand novel biomaterials that are emerging in the clinic. This integrated approach also gives engineering students a sense of the excitement and relevance of materials science in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.},

Here, we report a strategy to design tough transparent and conductive bonding of synthetic hydrogels containing 90\% water to non-porous surfaces of diverse solids, including glass, silicon, ceramics, titanium and aluminium. The design strategy is to anchor the long-chain polymer networks of tough hydrogels covalently to non-porous solid surfaces, which can be achieved by the silanation of such surfaces. Compared with physical interactions, the chemical anchorage results in a higher intrinsic work of adhesion and in significant energy dissipation of bulk hydrogel during detachment, which lead to interfacial toughness values over 1,000 J m−2. We also demonstrate applications of robust hydrogel–solid hybrids, including hydrogel superglues, mechanically protective hydrogel coatings, hydrogel joints for robotic structures and robust hydrogel–metal conductors.},

	abstract = {Monitoring macrophage metabolism in response to nanoparticle exposure provides new insights into biological outcomes, such as inflammation or toxicity, and supports the design of tailored nanomedicines. This paper describes the metabolic signature of macrophages exposed to nanoparticles ranging in diameter from 100 to 125 nm and made from silk, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or silica. Nanoparticles of this size and type are currently at various stages of preclinical and clinical development for drug delivery applications. 1H NMR analysis of cell extracts and culture media is used to quantify the changes in the intracellular and extracellular metabolomes of macrophages in response to nanoparticle exposure. Increased glycolytic activity, an altered tricarboxylic acid cycle, and reduced ATP generation are consistent with a proinflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, amino acids possibly arising from autophagy, the creatine kinase/phosphocreatine system, and a few osmolytes and antioxidants emerge as important players in the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages exposed to nanoparticles. This metabolic signature is a common response to all nanoparticles tested; however, the direction and magnitude of some variations are clearly nanoparticle specific, indicating material-induced biological specificity. Overall, metabolic reprogramming of macrophages can be achieved with nanoparticle treatments, modulated through the choice of the material, and monitored using 1H NMR metabolomics.},

The surface of the particles was modified by the adsorption of poloxamer blockcopolymers (coating). The relative phagocytic uptake was studied as a function of the molecular structure: the molecular weight and the lengths of the polyethylene oxide (EO) and the polypropylene oxide (PO) chains. Poloxamer polymers with short EO and PO chains were less effective in reducing phagocytosis. The protective effect was found to increase with increasing length of the EO or PO chains. Phagocytosis could be almost completely inhibited by polymers combining longest EO and PO chains (poloxamers 338 and 407). The observed reductions in in vitro phagocytic uptake were attributed to particle properties related to the thickness of the adsorbed layers, steric stabilization, and reduction in surface hydrophobicity.},

	abstract = {Background— Fixed drug release kinetics and vessel wall partitioning may limit the effectiveness of drug-eluting stents. We report preliminary experience using a new coronary stent with programmable pharmacokinetics.
Methods and Results— A newly designed metallic stent contains honeycombed strut elements with inlaid stacked layers of drug and polymer. In vitro studies evaluated recipes for loading paclitaxel to establish the parameters for controlling drug release. Manipulation of the layers of biodegradable polymer and drug allowed varying of the initial 24-hour burst release of paclitaxel from 69\% to 8.6\% (P{\textless}0.0001). Late release of drug could be adjusted dependently or independently of early burst release. A biphasic release profile was created by the addition of blank layers of polymer within the stack. In the 30-day porcine coronary model (n=17 pigs), there was a 70\% reduction in late loss (0.3±0.5 versus 1.0±0.5 mm, P=0.04), a 28\% increase in luminal volume (132±12 versus 103±21 mm3, P=0.02), and a 50\% decrease in histological neointimal area (2.0±0.5 versus 4.0±1.6 mm2; P{\textless}0.001) compared with bare metal controls. Temporal and regional variations in vascular healing were seen histologically.
Conclusions— Layered polymer/drug inlay stent technology permits flexible and controllable pharmacokinetic profiles. Programmable, complex chemotherapy using this approach may be feasible for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

The precursor is used to generate a second nanoparticle population, leading to high loading and conductivity. Establishing high nanoparticle loading in a microfibrous block copolymer network generated deformable composites that can sustain electrical conductivities reaching 9000 S/cm under 100\% tensile strain. These conductive elastic fabrics can retain at least 70\% of their initial electrical conductivity after being stretched to 100\% strain and released for 500 cycles.

Current mesh materials have a high incidence of repair failures, due to poor tissue integration, and complications such as seroma and pain. Polypropylene (PP) mesh is the standard material in hernia repair secondary to its material durability; however, failures still approach 15\%. In this first time animal study, we hypothesized that squid ring teeth (SRT), a biologically-derived high strength protein, coated polypropylene (SRT-PP) mesh, would offer enhanced tissue integration and strength compared to standard PP mesh, while proving biocompatibility for in vivo use. Materials and methods: Polypropylene mesh was coated with SRT. Mechanical properties and cell proliferation studies of the composite mesh were performed in vitro. Rats underwent inlay mesh implantation in an anterior abdominal wall defect model. Repair was assessed clinically and radiographically, with integration evaluated by histology and mechanical testing. Results: Cell proliferation was enhanced on SRT-PP composite mesh. This was corroborated by abdominal wall histology, dramatically diminished cranio-caudal mesh contraction, improved strength testing, and higher tissue failure strain following in vivo implantation. There was no increase in complications with SRT, with regard to seroma or visceral adhesion. No foreign body reactions were noted on liver histology. Conclusion: SRT-PP mesh showed better tissue integration than PP mesh. SRT is a high strength protein that is applied as a coating to augment mesh-tissue integration leading to improvements in abdominal wall stability with potential to reduce re-intervention for failures.},

Utility of this sealant to repair and seal a lower colonic resection and anastomosis procedure in a canine model was also investigated.ResultsWe show that a photopolymerised gelatin tissue sealant provides effective sealing of GI incisions and facilitates wound healing with no evidence of inflammation up to 28 days post-surgery. Blending of derivatised gelatin with underivatised gelatin allowed tuning of elasticity and elastic modulus of the photopolymerised sealant to suit surgical applications. High tissue adhesive strength was maintained at all blend ratios and exceeded 100 kPa.ConclusionsThis highly elastic and adhesive photopolymerised gelatin tissue sealant offers a number of advantages over currently available sealants suitable for GI surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {Gecko adhesion has become a paradigmatic example of bio-inspired engineering, yet among the many gecko-like synthetic adhesives (GSAs), truly gecko-like performance remains elusive. Many GSAs have previously demonstrated one or two features of the gecko adhesive. We present a new wedge-shaped GSA that exhibits several gecko-like properties simultaneously: directional features; zero force at detachment; high ratio of detachment force to preload force; non-adhesive default state; and the ability to maintain performance while sliding, even after thousands of cycles. Individual wedges independently detach and reattach during sliding, resulting in high levels of shear and normal adhesion during drag. This behaviour provides a non-catastrophic failure mechanism that is desirable for applications such as climbing robots where sudden contact failure would result in serious falls. The effects of scaling patch sizes up to tens of square centimetres are also presented and discussed. Patches of 1 cm2 had an adhesive pressure of 5.1 kPa while simultaneously supporting 17.0 kPa of shear. After 30 000 attachment/detachment cycles, a patch retained 67 per cent of its initial adhesion and 76 per cent of its initial shear without cleaning. Square-based wedges of 20 μm and 50 μm are manufactured in a moulding process where moulds are fabricated using a dual-side, dual-angle lithography process on quartz wafers with SU-8 photoresist as the mould material and polydimethylsiloxane as the cast material.},

	abstract = {Tissue adhesives are gaining popularity in ophthalmology, as they could potentially reduce the complications associated with current surgical methods. An ideal tissue adhesive should have superior tensile strength, be non-toxic and anti-inflammatory, improve efficiency and be cost-effective. Both synthetic and biological glues are available. The primary synthetic glues include cyanoacrylate and the recently introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives, while most biological glues are composed of fibrin. Cyanoacrylate has a high tensile strength, but rapidly polymerises upon contact with any fluid and has been associated with histotoxicity. Fibrin induces less toxic and inflammatory reactions, and its polymerisation time can be controlled. Tensile strength studies have shown that fibrin is not as strong as cyanoacrylate. While more research is needed, PEG variants currently appear to have the most promise. These glues are non-toxic, strong and time-effective. Through MEDLINE and internet searches, this paper presents a systematic review of the current applications of surgical adhesives to corneal, glaucoma, retinal, cataract and strabismus surgeries. Our review suggests that surgical adhesives have promise to reduce problems in current ophthalmic surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {Thoroughly revised and updated, the second edition of the landmark book Discussion as a Way of Teaching shows how to plan, conduct, and assess classroom discussions. Stephen D. Brookfield and Stephen Preskill suggest exercises for starting discussions, strategies for maintaining their momentum, and ways to elicit diverse views and voices. The book also includes new exercises and material on the intersections between discussion and the encouragement of democracy in the classroom. This revised edition expands on the original and contains information on adapting discussion methods in online teaching, on using discussion to enhance democratic participation, and on the theoretical foundations for the discussion exercises described in the book.     Throughout the book, Brookfield and Preskill clearly show how discussion can enliven classrooms, and they outline practical methods for ensuring that students will come to class prepared to discuss a topic. They also explain how to balance the voices of students and teachers, while still preserving the moral, political, and pedagogic integrity of discussion.},

	abstract = {Injury to the connective tissue that lines the lung, the pleura, or the lung itself can occur from many causes including trauma or surgery, as well as lung diseases or cancers. To address current limitations for patching lung injuries, to stop air or ﬂuid leaks, an adherent hydrogel sealant patch system was developed, based on methacrylated alginate (AMA) and AMA dialdehyde (AMA-DA) blends, which is capable of sealing damaged tissues and sustaining physiological pressures. Methacrylation of alginate hydroxyl groups rendered the polysaccharide capable of photocross-linking when mixed with an eosin Y-based photoinitiator system and exposed to visible green light. Oxidation of alginate yields functional aldehyde groups capable of imine bond formation with proteins found in many tissues. The alginate-based patch system was rigorously tested on a custom burst pressure testing device. Blending of nonoxidized material with oxidized (aldehyde modiﬁed) alginates yielded patches with improved burst pressure performance and decreased delamination as compared with pure AMA. Human mesothelial cell (MeT-5A) viability and cytotoxicity were retained when cultured with the hydrogel patches. The release and bioactivity of doxorubicin-encapsulated submicrospheres enabled the fabrication of drug-eluting adhesive patches and were eﬀective in decreasing human lung cancer cell (A549) viability.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; the predominant cause for mortality is metastasis to distant organs (e.g., lung). A major problem limiting the success of chemotherapy in metastatic CRC is the inability to target tumor tissues selectively and avoid severe side effects to normal tissues and organs. Here, we demonstrate polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) entrapping chemotherapeutic agents provide a new therapeutic option for treating CRC that has metastasized to the lung. PNPs assembled from FDA approved biocompatible block copolymer accumulated predominantly in lung tissue. PNPs showed negligible accumulation in liver, spleen and kidneys, which was confirmed by fluorescent nanoparticle imaging and analysis of PI3K inhibition in the organs. PNPs entrapping PI3K inhibitors (i.e., wortmannin and PX866) suppressed CRC lung metastasis growth, and SN-38loaded PNPs completely eliminated CRC lung metastasis. Our results demonstrate that polymerdrug nanoparticles offer a new approach to reduce toxicity of cancer therapy and has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with lung metastasis.},

Among the therapeutic arsenal to cancer control one could ﬁnd the Doxycycline and the nano hydroxyapatite. The Doxycycline (Dox) not only shown antibiotic eﬀect but also exhibits a wide range of pleiotropic therapeutic properties as the control of the invasive and metastatic cancer cells characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate both cytotoxicity in vitro and antibacterial activity of electrospun Dox-loaded hybrid nanoﬁbrous scaﬀolds composed by hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHA), poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and gelatin (Gel) polymers. Both nHA and Dox were dispersed into diﬀerent PCL/Gel ratios (70:30, 60:40, 50:50 wt\%) solutions to form electrospun nanoﬁbers. The nHA and Dox/nHA/PCLGel hybrid nanoﬁbers were characterized by TEM microscopy. In vitro Dox release behavior from all of these Dox-loaded nHA/PCL-Gel nanoﬁbers showed the same burst release proﬁle due to the high solubility of Gel in the release medium. Antibacterial properties of nanoﬁber composites were evaluated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) bacteria. The codelivery of nHA particles and Dox simultaneously exhibited inhibition of bacterial growth more eﬃciently than the delivery of either Dox or nHA at the same concentrations, indicating a synergistic eﬀect. The results showed that cancer cell tested had diﬀerent sensibility to co-delivery system. On the whole, A-431 cells were found exhibited the most pronounced synergistic eﬀect compared to CACO-2 and 4T1 cancer cells. Based on the anticancer as well as the antimicrobial results in this study, the developed Dox/nHA/PCL-Gel composite nanoﬁbers are suitable as a drug delivery system with potential applications in the biomedical ﬁelds.},

The focus is on the immediate and long term complications that would be important to both the general surgeon and those surgeons with specialty experience in bariatric surgery. Sections address the nutritional deficiencies following bariatric surgery with specific attention to Roux en Y gastric bypass and pancreatico-biliary diversion as well as the correction of these deficiencies with medical intervention as well as the indications for surgical revision or reversal. The text reviews the work-up of a bariatric patient with abdominal pain including the appropriate imaging and threshold for operative intervention and the techniques to achieve optimal visualization during this difficult situation. This section focuses on the operative management of anastomotic and staple line leaks and how to definitively manage these surgical emergencies as well as achieve source control and stabilization. Later chapters focus on specific complications following bariatric surgery with specific focus on RYGB, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), biliary pancreatic diversion, and gastric band. Complications include gastric fistula, gastric staple line disruption following VSG, gastro-jejunal leak following RYGB, relux following bariatric surgery, and failure of weight loss following bariatric surgery. These sections are written by experts in the field of bariatrics and include evidence based medicine as well as expert opinion on the management of bariatric complications. The sections provide a review of the literature and references at the close of each section.Complications in Bariatric Surgery will serve as a resource for both the general surgeon who handles bariatric emergencies as well as the bariatric specialist.},

The combined use of nanoparticles and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine requires more knowledge of the inﬂuence of nanoparticles on cell viability and diﬀerentiation potential of hMSCs. The objective of this study is to investigate the in vitro uptake of silica nanoparticles (silica NPs) and their eﬀect on adipogenic diﬀerentiation of hMSCs. After exposure of hMSCs to silica NPs, the uptake and localization of silica NPs were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The adipogenic diﬀerentiation potential of hMSCs was examined by analyzing the formation and accumulation of lipids droplets, triglyceride (TG) content and the expression of adipogenic marker genes/proteins. The results showed that silica NPs did not aﬀect the cell viability but signiﬁcantly decreased the diﬀerentiation of hMSCs to adipocytes. These ﬁndings improve the understanding of the inﬂuence of silica NPs on adipogenic diﬀerentiation of hMSCs and will provide a reference for the applications of silica NPs in biomedical and bioengineering ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Described here is an anticancer material based on colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with doxorubicin (DOX), and incorporated into Pluronic F127 hydrogels for prolonged release, with a potential therapeutic application for prostate cancer treatment. The MSNs have spherical morphology, size of about 60 nm, surface area of 970 cm2 g−1 and average pore width of 2.0 nm. A high colloidal stability for the MSNs in the physiological medium used for in vivo administration (NaCl 0.9\% w/v) could be attained in the presence of PF127 (from 5 to 18 wt \%), where depletion repulsion forces prevent MSN agglomeration. By conjugating DOX, MSN and PF127 (18 wt \%) in NaCl 0.9\%, the hybrid system has a gelation temperature of 21 °C, which allowed its in vivo administration in the liquid form and further in situ gelation, generating a drug depot system inside the animals after peritoneal injection. The systems were tested in rats with chemically induced prostate cancer and, after this treatment, histopathological analyses conﬁrmed (i) a reduction in the frequency of aggressive tumors; (ii) that the antitumor eﬀect was dependent on MSN concentration; and most importantly (iii) the reduction of DOX intrinsic cardiotoxicity, indicating that the MSNs play a cardioprotective eﬀect.},

	abstract = {Fibrosis is deﬁned by the overgrowth, hardening, and/or scarring of various tissues and is attributed to excess deposition of extracellular matrix components including collagen. Fibrosis is the end result of chronic inﬂammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli including persistent infections, autoimmune reactions, allergic responses, chemical insults, radiation, and tissue injury. Although current treatments for ﬁbrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis, liver cirrhosis, systemic sclerosis, progressive kidney disease, and cardiovascular ﬁbrosis typically target the inﬂammatory response, there is accumulating evidence that the mechanisms driving ﬁbrogenesis are distinct from those regulating inﬂammation. In fact, some studies have suggested that ongoing inﬂammation is needed to reverse established and progressive ﬁbrosis. The key cellular mediator of ﬁbrosis is the myoﬁbroblast, which when activated serves as the primary collagen-producing cell. Myoﬁbroblasts are generated from a variety of sources including resident mesenchymal cells, epithelial and endothelial cells in processes termed epithelial/endothelial-mesenchymal (EMT/EndMT) transition, as well as from circulating ﬁbroblast-like cells called ﬁbrocytes that are derived from bone-marrow stem cells. Myoﬁbroblasts are activated by a variety of mechanisms, including paracrine signals derived from lymphocytes and macrophages, autocrine factors secreted by myoﬁbroblasts, and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) produced by pathogenic organisms that interact with pattern recognition receptors (i.e. TLRs) on ﬁbroblasts. Cytokines (IL-13, IL-21, TGF-β1), chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1β), angiogenic factors (VEGF), growth factors (PDGF), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs), acute phase proteins (SAP), caspases, and components of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (ANG II) have been identiﬁed as important regulators of ﬁbrosis and are being investigated as potential targets of antiﬁbrotic drugs. This review explores our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ﬁbrogenesis.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, a variety of advanced silver-based dressings have been developed. There are considerable variations in the structure, composition, and silver content of these new preparations. In the present study, we examined ﬁve commercially available silver-based dressings (Acticoatt, Aquacels Ag, Contreets Foam, PolyMems Silver, UrgotulsSSD). We assessed their cytotoxicity in a monolayer cell culture, a tissue explant culture model, and a mouse excisional wound model. The results showed that Acticoatt, Aquacels Ag, and Contreets Foam, when pretreated with specific solutes, were likely to produce the most significant cytotoxic effects on both cultured keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts, while PolyMems Silver and UrgotulsSSD demonstrated the least cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity correlated with the silver released from the dressings as measured by silver concentration in the culture medium. In the tissue explant culture model, in which the epidermal cell proliferation was evaluated, all silver dressings resulted in a significant delay of reepithelialization. In the mouse excisional wound model, Acticoatt and Contreets Foam indicated a strong inhibition of wound reepithelialization on the postwounding-day 7. These ﬁndings may, in part, explain the clinical observations of delayed wound healing or inhibition of wound epithelialization after the use of certain topical silver dressings. Caution should be exercised in using silverbased dressings in clean superﬁcial wounds such as donor sites and superﬁcial burns and also when cultured cells are being applied to wounds.},

The study of bactericidal nanomaterials is particularly timely considering the recent increase of new resistant strains of bacteria to the most potent antibiotics. This has promoted research in the well known activity of silver ions and silver-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles. The present work studies the effect of silver nanoparticles in the range of 1–100 nm on Gram-negative bacteria using high angle annular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our results indicate that the bactericidal properties of the nanoparticles are size dependent, since the only nanoparticles that present a direct interaction with the bacteria preferentially have a diameter of ∼1–10 nm.},

During wound healing an extensive, but immature and leaky vascular plexus forms which is subsequently reduced by regression of non-functional vessels. More recent studies indicate that uncontrolled vessel growth or impaired vessel regression as a consequence of an excessive inﬂammatory response can impair wound healing, resulting in scarring and dysfunction. However, in order to elucidate targetable factors to promote functional tissue regeneration we need to understand the molecular and cellular underpinnings of physiological angiogenesis, ranging from induction to resolution of blood vessels. Especially for avascular tissues (e.g. cornea, tendon, ligament, cartilage, etc.), limiting rather than boosting vessel growth during wound repair potentially is beneﬁcial to restore full tissue function and may result in favourable long-term healing outcomes.},

Superior antimicrobial activity has been provided through fabrication of silver nanoparticles or nanosilver (NAg), which imparts cytotoxic actions distinct from those of bulk silver. In the wake of the recent discoveries of bacterial resistance to NAg and its rising incorporation in medical and consumer goods such as wound dressings and dietary supplements, we argue that there is an urgent need to monitor the prevalence and spread of NAg microbial resistance. In this Perspective, we describe how the use of NAg in commercially available products facilitates prolonged microorganism exposure to bioavailable silver, which underpins the development of resistance. Furthermore, we advocate for a judicial approach toward NAg use in order to preserve its eﬃcacy and to avoid environmental disruption.},

Antibacterial properties of mats were tested against E. coli and S. aureus by turbidity and MTT assays. The effect of UVA illumination (prior to bacteria inoculation) on mats’ antibacterial activity was also studied. Results showed that a coaxial-fibers design maintained nanoparticles distributed in the outer shell of fibers and, in general, enhanced the antibacterial effect of the mats, in comparison to conventional uniaxial-fibers mats. Results indicated that mats simultaneously inhibited planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth by, probably, two main antibacterial mechanisms; 1) release of Zn2+ ions (mainly from Zn acetate nanoparticles) and 2) photocatalytic oxidative processes exerted by ZnO nanoparticles. Antibacterial properties of mats were significantly improved by coaxial-fibers design and exposure to UVA-light prior to bacteria inoculation.},

In the adults, wound healing aims at quickly restoring the barrier function of the skin, leading however to scar, a dysfunctional fibrotic tissue. On the other hand, in fetuses a scarless tissue regeneration takes place. During ageing, the wound healing capacity declines; however, in the absence of comorbidities a higher quality in tissue repair is observed. Senescent cells have been found to accumulate in chronic unhealed wounds, but more recent reports indicate that their transient presence may be beneficial for tissue repair. In this review data on skin wound healing and scarring are presented, covering the whole spectrum from early embryonic development to adulthood, and furthermore until ageing of the organism.},

	abstract = {Cooperation between researchers in the areas of medical, pharmaceutical and materials science has facilitated the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms that elicit therapeutic effects and protective action with a single product. In addition to optimizing pharmacologic action, such dosage forms provide greater patient comfort and increase success and treatment compliance. In the present work, we prepared semipermeable bioactive electrospun ﬁbers for use as wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine complexed with β-cyclodextrin in a poly(Ɛ-caprolactone) nanoﬁber matrix aiming to reduce the direct contact between silver and skin and to modulate the drug release. Wound dressings were prepared by electrospinning, and were subjected to ATR-FT-IR and TG/DTG assays to evaluate drug stability. The hydrophilicity of the ﬁbrous nanostructure in water and PBS buffer was studied by goniometry. Electrospun ﬁbers permeability and swelling capacity were assessed, and a dissolution test was performed. In vitro biological tests were realized to investigate the biological compatibility and antimicrobial activity. We obtained ﬂexible matrices that were each approximately 1.0 g in weight. The electrospun ﬁbers were shown to be semipermeable, with water vapor transmission and swelling indexes compatible with the proposed objective. The hydrophilicity was moderate. Matrices containing pure drug modulated drug release adequately during 24 h but presented a high hemolytic index. Complexation promoted a decrease in the hemolytic index and in the drug release but did not negatively impact antimicrobial activity. The drug was released predominantly by diffusion. These results indicate that electrospun PCL matrices containing β-cyclodextrin/silver sulfadiazine inclusion complexes are a promising pharmaceutical dosage form for wound healing.},

Myriad dendrimer-like Ag star morphologies were synthesized by varying the amount of poly(vinyl alcohol) and trisodium citrate used during silver reduction. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that star-shaped silver–polymer composites possessing nanoscopic, fractal morphologies with diameters ranging from 500 nm to 7 μm were produced. These composites have broad applications from antibacterial agents to catalysis; two such applications were tested here. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) studies showed multiple hot spots of SERS activity within a single star. Electrochemical catalysis experiments demonstrated the feasibility of using the silver stars instead of platinum for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline fuel cells.},

	abstract = {The preparation of a stable nanoparticle stock suspension is the ﬁrst step in nanotoxicological studies, but how different preparation methods inﬂuence the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in a solution, even in Milli-Q water, is often under-appreciated. In this study, a systematic approach using a central composite design (CCD) was employed to investigate the effects of sonication time and suspension concentration on the physicochemical properties (i.e. hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential and ion dissolution) of silver (Ag) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) and to identify optimal conditions for suspension preparation in Milli-Q water; deﬁned as giving the smallest particle sizes, highest suspension stability and lowest ion dissolution. Indeed, all the physicochemical properties of AgNPs and CuONPs varied dramatically depending on how the stock suspensions were prepared and differed profoundly between nanoparticle types, indicating the importance of suspension preparation. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of AgNPs and CuONPs, at least in simple media (Milli-Q water), behaved in predictable ways as a function of sonication time and suspension concentration, conﬁrming the validity of our models. Overall, the approach allows systematic assessment of the inﬂuence of various factors on key properties of nanoparticle suspensions, which will facilitate optimization of the preparation of nanoparticle stock suspensions and improve the reproducibility of nanotoxicological results. We recommend that further attention be given to details of stock suspension preparation before conducting nanotoxicological studies as these can have an important inﬂuence on the behavior and subsequent toxicity of nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {Introduction: While autologous skin grafting has been the standard for coverage of fullthickness areas, several options for deep-partial-thickness defects exist. With regard to economising donor sites, we compared a copolymer based on DL-lactid acid (Suprathel1) as temporary wound dressing with autologous skin, and analysed time to healing and scar quality in matched areas of deep-partial-thickness burn.
Methods: We recruited 18 patients with a median age of 45 years (range: 25–83 years), for this prospective, non-blinded controlled non-inferiority study, suffering from deep-partialthickness burns from November 2009 to July 2010. After early tangential excision, matched deep-partial-thickness areas were covered with 1:1.5 meshed autologous skin grafts and the copolymer for direct intra-individual comparison. Scars were evaluated by means of the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and suction cutometry (MPA 580, Courage and Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany) on days 30 and 90, postoperatively.
Results: Fifteen days after surgery, complete wound closure was present in 44.4\% (8/18) of all areas covered with copolymer and 88.9\% (16/18) in the split-thickness skin graft (STSG) area ( p = 0.008). Evaluation of the total VSS, POSAS and cutometry satisﬁed the criterion of noninferiority for Suprathel1 on day 30. Ninety days after surgery, only the Observer Scar Scale showed that Suprathel is non-inferior to STSG, albeit the mean total VSS and Patient Scar Scale were better in Suprathel1 areas.
Conclusion: Suprathel1 represents a solid, reliable epidermal skin substitute with longer healing times in comparison to skin grafts but comparable results concerning early scar formation. Suprathel1 can serve as a tool in treatment portfolio for adult patients suffering from deep dermal burns. Especially in patients with extensive burns, Suprathel1 can be used to cover the deep dermal burn wounds to save STSGs and its donor sites for the coverage of full-thickness burned areas.},

But due to the emergence of several antibiotics the use of these silver compounds has been declined remarkably. Nanotechnology is gaining tremendous impetus in the present century due to its capability of modulating metals into their nanosize, which drastically changes the chemical, physical and optical properties of metals. Metallic silver in the form of silver nanoparticles has made a remarkable comeback as a potential antimicrobial agent. The use of silver nanoparticles is also important, as several pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance against various antibiotics. Hence, silver nanoparticles have emerged up with diverse medical applications ranging from silver based dressings, silver coated medicinal devices, such as nanogels, nanolotions, etc.},

This has given the practitioner choice but little evidence by which an appropriate dressing may be selected. In many instances, the ancillary function(s) of the dressing will become differentiating factors that inﬂuence choice. For example, the dressing capacity to manage exudate, maintain an optimum moist environment, reduce or avoid maceration, maintain an intimate contact with the wound bed, promote autolytic debridement, sequester bacteria and bind matrix metallo proteases (MMPs) are some of those functions that are of clinical signiﬁcance and may dictate choice.

	abstract = {Certain concentrations of the antiseptic AgNO3, a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, exert cytotoxic effects on ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells which are directly related to the wound-healing process. In vitro assessment of human ﬁbroblast cytotoxicity has proved to be a useful method for characterizing cell toxicity mechanisms of topically-applied antiseptics. In the present study human dermal ﬁbroblasts were exposed to AgNO3 at concentrations of 4.12 – 82.4 vM for 8 and 24 h. Silver ions greatly inhibited ﬁbroblast proliferation and prolonged AgNO3 exposure produced Ag-dependent cell loss. In the sequence of events occurring during our in vitro experimental model, the inhibitory action on DNA synthesis was the primary event in AgNO3 cytotoxicity, associated with signiﬁcant loss of cell protein. Both parameters decreased as the content of fetal calf serum (FCS) in the exposure medium was gradually reduced from 10 to 2\%. The parallel study of DNA synthesis and cell protein content suggests that the toxic damage produced by silver in different phases of the cell cycle may lead to destruction of the entire cell population and therefore hinder the tissue regeneration process. A concentration- and time-dependent depletion of intracellular ATP content is also caused by ionic silver, thereby compromising the cell energy charge which precedes human dermal ﬁbroblast death. Concomitant incorporation of FCS to the medium always attenuated Ag+ cytotoxicity curves in a concentration-dependent fashion and maximum protection was observed at 10\% in situations closely resembling physiological conditions. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Most of the recent work on electrospinning has focused either on trying to understand deeper the fundamental aspects of the process in order to gain control of nanofiber morphology, structure, surface functionality, and strategies for assembling them or on determining appropriate conditions for electrospinning of various polymers and biopolymers.},

	abstract = {New nanocomposite ﬁlms based on a biodegradable poly (DL-Lactide-co-Glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) and different concentration of silver nanoparticles (Ag) were developed by solvent casting. In vitro degradation studies of PLGA/Ag nanocomposites were conducted under physiological conditions, over a 5 week period, and compared to the behaviour of the neat polymer. Furthermore the silver ions (Ag?) release upon degradation was monitored to obtain information on the properties of the nanocomposites during the incubation. The obtained results suggest that the PLGA ﬁlm morphology can be modiﬁed introducing a small percentage of silver nanoparticles that do not affect the degradation mechanism of PLGA polymer in the nanocomposite. However results clearly evinced the stabilizing effect of the Ag nanoparticles in the PLGA polymer and the mineralization process induced by the combined effect of silver and nanocomposite surface topography. The Ag? release can be controlled by the polymer degradation processes, evidencing a prolonged antibacterial effect.},

	abstract = {The disintegration under composting conditions of ﬁlms based on poly(lactic acid)epoly(hydroxybutyrate) (PLAePHB) blends and intended for food packaging was studied. Two different plasticizers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and acetyl-tri-n-butyl citrate (ATBC), were used to limit the inherent brittleness of both biopolymers. Neat PLA, plasticized PLA and PLAePHB ﬁlms were processed by meltblending and compression molding and they were further treated under composting conditions in a laboratory-scale test at 58 Æ 2  C. Disintegration levels were evaluated by monitoring their weight loss at different times: 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Morphological changes in all formulations were followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The inﬂuence of plasticizers on the disintegration of PLA and PLAePHB blends was studied by evaluating their thermal and nanomechanical properties by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the nanoindentation technique, respectively. Meanwhile, structural changes were followed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ability of PHB to act as nucleating agent in PLAePHB blends slowed down the PLA disintegration, while plasticizers speeded it up. The relationship between the mesolactide to lactide forms of PLA was calculated with a Pyrolysis eGas ChromatographyeMass Spectrometry device (PyeGC/MS), revealing that the mesolactide form increased during composting.},

This review will identify and discuss the three major classes of hemostatic approaches: biologically derived materials, synthetically derived materials, and intravenously administered hemostatic agents. The general class is first discussed, then specific approaches discussed in detail, including the hemostatic mechanisms and the advancement of the method. As hemostatic strategies evolve and synthetic-biologic interactions are more fully understood, current clinical methodologies will be replaced. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A review article is presented of the research results obtained by the author on the properties of amorphous silica surface. It has been shown that in any description of the surface silica the hydroxylation of the surface is of critical importance. An analysis was made of the processes of dehydration (the removal of physically adsorbed water), dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups from the silica surface), and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hydroxyl covering). For each of these processes a probable mechanism is suggested. The results of experimental and theoretical studies permitted to construct the original model (Zhuravlev model-1 and model-2) for describing the surface chemistry of amorphous silica. The main advantage of this physico-chemical model lies in the possibility to determine the concentration and the distribution of different types of silanol and siloxane groups and to characterize the energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface as a function of the pretreatment temperature of SiO2 samples. The model makes it possible to determine the kind of the chemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activated or slow, strongly activated) under the restoration of the hydroxyl covering and also to assess of OH groups inside the SiO2 skeleton. The magnitude of the silanol number, that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface area, hOH, when the surface is hydroxylated to the maximum degree, is considered to be a physico-chemical constant. This constant has a numerical value: hOH,AVER = 4.6 (least-squares method) and hOH,AVER = 4.9 OH nm−2 (arithmetical mean) and is known in literature as the Kiselev–Zhuravlev constant. It has been established that adsorption and other surface properties per unit surface area of silica are identical (except for very ﬁne pores). On the basis of data published in the literature, this model has been found to be useful in solving various applied and theoretical problems in the ﬁeld of adsorption, catalysis, chromatography, chemical modiﬁcation, etc. It has been shown that the Brunauer – Emmett–Teller (BET) method is the correct method and gives the opportunity to measure the real physical magnitude of the speciﬁc surface area, SKr (by using low temperature adsorption of krypton), for silicas and other oxide dispersed solids. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, agreed plasticizers for food contact were melt mixed with L-PLA and then, the glass transition, melting, crystallization and mechanical properties of the blends were investigated. The experimental results were compared to the predicted results found through empirical interaction parameters and Fox equations. Molecular scale miscibility is assumed in the amorphous phase whatever the plasticizer. The mobility gained by the PLA chains in the plasticized blends yields crystallization, which is the driving force for various scale phase separations.},

The morphology of PPO/PA6 nanocomposite with various amounts of clay has been investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). For the PPO/PA6 blend without clay, PPO is dispersed in the PA6 matrix with an average particle diameter of about 4.2 mm. The domain size of the dispersed PPO phase is signiﬁcantly decreased to about 1.1 mm by adding a small amount of clay (2\%). However, when the amount of organoclay is more than 5\%, the matrix-domain structure is found to transform into the co-continuous morphology. The TEM observation shows that all the organoclay is dispersed only in the PA6 phase with a high degree of exfoliation and there is no any clay detectable in the PPO phase for the nanocomposites regardless of the amount of clay. It is considered that the dispersed clay platelets play an important role in the control of the PPO/PA6 blend morphology. Firstly, the selective localization of clay in PA6 phase changes the viscosity ratio of the PPO and PA6 phases. Therefore, clay has signiﬁcant effects on the morphology of the polymer blend. Secondly, the high aspect ratio of the clay platelets prevents the coalescence of domains during melt mixing.},

Herein, we present a systematic rheological study on nanosilicacompatibilized PVDF/PLLA (poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride)/poly(L-lactide)) blends. The linear viscoelastic properties of the systems are evaluated using small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS). It is found that the interfacial jammed Janus grafted silica (JGS) located at the interface increases dynamic moduli at low frequency even with very low ﬁller loadings. The nonterminal eﬀects become more pronounced with increasing JGS loadings. Weighted relaxation spectra inferred from SAOS reveals that the shape relaxation of PVDF-droplets is strongly inﬂuenced by addition of JGS. The solid-like behavior of JGS-ﬁlled blends has been attributed to both the orderly arrangement of JGS at PVDF−PLLA interface and the molecular entanglement between the grafted long tails of JGS with the molecular chains of the component polymers. In other words, JGS at the interface not only promotes strong interfacial interactions between phases, but also stimulates the formation of unique nanoparticle−polymer hybrid network, termed as “heterogeneous network” with the silica as the junctions.},

	abstract = {The exclusive location of compatibilizers at the interface of immiscible binary polymer blends to bridge the neighboring phases is the most important issue for fabricating desirable materials with synergistic properties. However, the positional stability of the compatibilizers at the interface remains a challenge in both scientiﬁc and technical points of view due to the intrinsic ﬂexibility of compatibilizer molecules against aggressive processing conditions. Herein, taking the typical immiscible poly vinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)/polylactic acid (PLLA) blend as an example, we demonstrate a novel approach, termed as the interfacial nanoparticle compatibilization (IPC) mechanism, to overcome the challenges by packing nanoparticles thermodynamically at the interface through melt reactive blending. Speciﬁcally, we have ﬁrst synthesized nanosilica with both reactive epoxide groups and long poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) tails, called reactive PMMA-graf t-SiO2 (Epoxy-MSiO2), and then incorporated the Epoxy-MSiO2 into the PVDF/PLLA (50/50, w/w) blends by melt blending. PLLA was in situ grafted onto SiO2 by the reaction of the carboxylic acid groups with epoxide groups on the surface of SiO2. Therefore, the reacted SiO2 particles were exclusively located at the interface by the formation of the Janus-faced silica hybrid nanoparticles (JSNp) with pregrafted PMMA tails entangled with PVDF molecular chains in the PVDF phase and the in situ grafted PLLA chains embedded in the PLLA phase. Such JSNp with a distinct hemisphere, functioning as compatibilizer, can not only suppress coalescence of PVDF domains by its steric repulsion but also enhance interfacial adhesion via the selective interactions with the corresponding miscible phase. The interfacial location of JSNp is very stable even under the severe shear ﬁeld and annealing in the melt. This IPC mechanism paves a new possibility to use the various types of nanoparticles as both eﬀective compatibilizers and functional ﬁllers for immiscible polymer blends.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study evaluated the in vitro antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of various commercially available silver-containing dressings (Ag dressing).
Methods: Biohesive Ag (hydrocolloid, silver sulfadiazine), Aquacel® Ag (nonwoven fabric, ionic silver [Ag+]), Algisite™ Ag (nonwoven fabric, Ag+), Mepilex® Ag (foam, silver sulfate), and PolyMem® Ag (foam, nanocrystalline silver) were tested for characteristics of Ag+ release, antibacterial activity, and cytotoxicity. The release of Ag+ was investigated in cell culture medium at immersion periods of 6, 24, and 48 hours. The antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were accessed by a disc diffusion test. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using V79 cells, by an extraction method.
Results: The cytotoxicity was not a monotonic function of the antibacterial activity among the Ag dressings and could not be simply explained by Ag+-release properties. Biohesive Ag was regarded as a slow-release Ag dressing, showing the lowest cytotoxicity, while the antibacterial activity was classified as “strong” or “significant” against the two species of bacteria. Aquacel Ag and Algisite Ag showed higher antibacterial activity and cytotoxic effects, which were supported by the higher Ag+ release. Mepilex Ag showed the highest release of Ag+, and the cytotoxicity was the highest among the Ag dressings. However, the antibacterial activity was classified as “significant” or “no activity” for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. PolyMem Ag showed the lowest Ag+ release, and the antibacterial activity classified as “significant” or “no activity” for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively, whereas the cytotoxicity was similar to those of Aquacel Ag and Algisite Ag.
Conclusion: The efficacy and adverse effects of the Ag dressings revealed differences that should be considered by clinicians during wound management.},

Addition of non-silver-containing dressing altered the growth kinetics while addition of silver (contained either in a dressing or as AgNO3 solution) was seen to elicit inhibition and/or kill depending on concentration. Tests were conducted in nutrient broth and simulated wound ﬂuid. It was found that minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration values were higher in simulated wound ﬂuid and under anaerobic conditions. Bioavailability of silver from the wound dressing was 35\% against S. aureus in nutrient broth and 68\% against both species in simulated wound ﬂuid.

	abstract = {Metallothionein (MT), a low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding protein, has been implicated in the detoxification of Cd. However, whether MT protects against the cellular toxicity of other metals has not been examined thoroughly. This study was therefore designed to determine the effects of Zn-induced MT on the toxicity of seven metals in rat primary hepatocyte cultures. Hepatocytes were grown in monolayer culture for 22 hr and subsequently treated with ZnCl2 (100 μm) for 24 hr which produced a 15-fold increase in MT concentration. Following Zn pretreatment, hepatocytes were exposed to various concentrations of Ag, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, or Zn for 24 hr. Cytotoxicity was assessed by enzyme leakage and loss of intracellular K+. The toxicity of all seven metals was significantly less in the Zn-pretreated cells. Zn pretreatment had no appreciable effect on the hepatocellular uptake (1–24 hr) of 110Ag or 203Hg, but markedly altered their subcellular distribution, with metals accumulating more in the cytosol and less in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. In the cytosol of control cells, the metals were bound mainly to high-molecular-weight proteins whereas in the Zn-pretreated cells, the metals were mainly associated with MT. In summary, Zn-induced MT in rat primary hepatocyte cultures protects against Ag-, Co-, Cu-, Hg-, Ni-, Pb-, and Zn-induced cytotoxicity. This protection appears to be due to the binding of metals to MT with a concomitant reduction of metal content in critical organelles and proteins.},

	abstract = {The cytotoxicity of commonly used antimicrobial and antiseptic agents to cultured human keratinocytes was investigated, combining a morphologic assay with a quantitative neutral red (NR) spectrophotometric assay. Main outcome criteria of response were the initial cytotoxicity (NR 90) and midpoint cytotoxicity (NR 50) and the highest tolerated dose (HTD), a concentration causing the first observed morphologic alterations. These values were compared with commonly administered clinical doses or calculated doses. Thirty-five agents were evaluated; five agents were also subjected to an assay for cell morphologic alterations, and HTD and percentage of cells taking up trypan blue and annihilation dose were assessed. These studies show that in clinical concentrations many, but not all, agents exert profound cytotoxic effects. The results suggest that under certain conditions cultured epithelial grafts may be exposed to clinical concentrations of neomycin, clindamycin, framycetin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and 0.1\% solutions of povidone-iodine. Tetrachlorodecaoxygen anion complex (TCDO) should be further evaluated as a likely effective cleansing agent before culture grafting.},

At therapeutic concentrations all the antiseptics are cytotoxic for fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Additionally the cells were exposed for 48 h to vancomycin, colistin, amikacin, imipeneme, pefloxaxin, piperacillin and cell viability was determined using the MTT test. The concentrations of antibiotics corresponding to the plasma peak obtained after therapeutic appliction were not cytotoxic to the tested cells. The CD50 was much higher than the MIC (from 125 to 875 times for keratinocytes and from 1400 to 5900 times for fibroblasts). These data suggest that commonly applied antiseptics must not be used before grafting cultured skin grafts.

Recently, we reported that silica nanoparticles (SN) cause more damage to liver instead of lung when they enter the body by intravenous injection. However, this mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, liver damages caused by mesoporous hollow silica nanoparticles (MHSNs) were demonstrated after continuous intraperitoneal injection into mice twice a week for 6 weeks. The administration of MHSNs at 50 mg/kg increased liver injury markers in serum, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), inﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Histological analysis revealed lymphocytic inﬁltration and silicotic nodular like lesions in liver. Collagen ﬁbers were observed around the silicotic nodular like lesion, and hydroxyproline level in liver was also increased dramatically. We also found that activated kupffer cells (KCs) played a key role in the liver damage caused by SNs similar to alveolar macrophage in the process of silicosis. These suggest that the mechanism of liver damage caused by SNs is in consonance with the occurrence of silicosis. These ﬁndings may provide useful information for the further toxicity and bioapplication research of nanoparticles.},

Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and PLGA–polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PLGA–PEG) blend nanoparticles containing curcumin were obtained by a single-emulsion solvent-evaporation technique, resulting in particles size smaller than 200 nm. The encapsulation efﬁciency was over 70\% for both formulations. The in vitro release study showed that curcumin was released more slowly from the PLGA nanoparticles than from the PLGA–PEG nanoparticles. A LC–MS/MS method was developed and validated to quantify curcumin in rat plasma. The nanoparticles were orally administered at a single dose in rats, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated and compared with the curcumin aqueous suspension. It was observed that both nanoparticles formulations were able to sustain the curcumin delivery over time, but greater efﬁciency was obtained with the PLGA–PEG nanoparticles, which showed better results in all of the pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed. The PLGA and PLGA–PEG nanoparticles increased the curcumin mean half-life in approximately 4 and 6 h, respectively, and the Cmax of curcumin increased 2.9- and 7.4-fold, respectively. The distribution and metabolism of curcumin decreased when it was carried by nanoparticles, particularly PLGA–PEG nanoparticles. The bioavailability of curcumin-loaded PLGA–PEG nanoparticles was 3.5-fold greater than the curcumin from PLGA nanoparticles. Compared to the curcumin aqueous suspension, the PLGA and PLGA–PEG nanoparticles increased the curcumin bioavailability by 15.6- and 55.4-fold, respectively. These results suggest that PLGA and, in particular, PLGA–PEG blend nanoparticles are potential carriers for the oral delivery of curcumin.},

Water insoluble polymers are used as encapsulation matrix using this technique. Biodegradable polymer PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) is frequently used as encapsulation material. Different kinds of drugs have been successfully encapsulation: for example hydrophobic drugs such as cisplatin, lidocaine, naltrexone and progesterone; and hydrophilic drugs such as insulin, proteins, peptide and vaccine. The choice of encapsulation materials and the testing of the release of drug have been intensively investigated. However process-engineering aspects of this technique remain poorly reported. To succeed in the controlled manufacturing of microspheres, it is important to investigate the latter. This article reviews the current state of the art concerning this technique by focusing on the inﬂuence of the physical properties of materials and operating conditions on the microspheres obtained. Based on the existing results and authors’ reﬂection, it gives rise to reasoning and suggested choices of materials and process conditions. A part of this paper is also dedicated to numerical models on the solvent evaporation and the solidiﬁcation of microspheres. This review reveals also the surprising lack of knowledge on certain aspects, such as the mechanism of formation of pores in the microspheres and the experimental study on the solidiﬁcation of microspheres.},

For example, nanoparticle systems are capable of delivering therapeutics and treating areas of the body that other delivery systems cannot reach. As such, nanoparticle drug delivery and imaging systems are one of the most investigated systems in preclinical and clinical settings. Here, we will highlight the diversity of nanoparticle types, the key advantages these systems have over their free drug counterparts, and discuss their overall potential in inﬂuencing clinical care. In particular, we will focus on current clinical trials for nanoparticle formulations that have yet to be clinically approved. Additional emphasis will be on clinically approved nanoparticle systems, both for their currently approved indications and their use in active clinical trials. Finally, we will discuss many of the often overlooked biological, technological, and study design challenges that impact the clinical success of nanoparticle delivery systems.},

	abstract = {The interactions of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) of diﬀerent particle sizes and surface properties with human red blood cell (RBC) membranes were investigated by membrane ﬁltration, ﬂow cytometry, and various microscopic techniques. Small MCM-41-type MSNs (∼100 nm) were found to adsorb to the surface of RBCs without disturbing the membrane or morphology. In contrast, adsorption of large SBA-15-type MSNs (∼600 nm) to RBCs induced a strong local membrane deformation leading to spiculation of RBCs, internalization of the particles, and eventual hemolysis. In addition, the relationship between the degree of MSN surface functionalization and the degree of its interaction with RBC, as well as the eﬀect of RBC-MSN interaction on cellular deformability, were investigated. The results presented here provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of RBC-MSN interaction and the hemolytic activity of MSNs and will assist in the rational design of hemocompatible MSNs for intravenous drug delivery and in vivo imaging.},

These uniform SNPs of precisely controlled sizes eliminated uncertainties arising from mixed sizes, and uniquely allowed the probing of effects entirely size-dependent. Cell viability, membrane disruption, oxidative stress, and cellular uptake were studied. The extent and mechanism of SNP cytotoxicity were found to be not only size and dose dependent, but also highly cell type dependent. Furthermore, the 60 nm SNPs exhibited highly unusual behavior in comparison to particles of other sizes tested, implying interesting possibilities for controlling cellular activities using nanoparticles. Specifically, the 60 nm SNPs were preferentially endocytosed by cells and, at high doses, caused a disproportionate decrease in cell viability.

	abstract = {Background: The current progress in pharmaceutical nanotechnology ﬁeld has been exploited in the design of functionalized radiolabelled nanoparticles that are able to deliver radionuclides in a selective manner to improve the outcome of diagnosis and treatment. Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) have been widely developed for biomedical applications due to their high versatility, excellent functional properties and low cost production, with the possibility to control different topological parameters relevant for multidisciplinary applications.
Purpose: The aim of the present study was to characterize and evaluate both in vitro, by microscopy techniques, and in vivo, by scintigraphic imaging, the biodistribution of silica nanostructures derivatives (Cy5.5 conjugated SNPs and 99mTc radiolabelled SNPs) to be applied as radiotracers in biomedicine.
Methods: SNPs were synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of silicon alkoxides, followed by surface functionalization with amino groups available for ﬂuorescent dye and radiolabelling possibility.
Results: Our data showed the particles size distribution (200–350 nm), the surface charge (negative for bare and ﬂuorescent SNPs and positive for amino SNPs), polydispersity index (broad distribution), the qualitative composition and the toxicity assessments (safe material) that made the obtained SNPs candidates for in vitro/in vivo studies. A high uptake of ﬂuorescent SNPs in all the investigated organs was evidenced by confocal microscopy. The 99mTc radiolabelled SNPs biodistribution was quantiﬁed in the range of 12–100\% counts/g organ using the scintigraphic images.
Conclusions: The obtained results reveal improved properties, namely, reduced toxicity with a low level of side effects, an improved biodistribution, high labelling efﬁciency and stability of the radiolabelled SNPs with potential to be applied in biomedical science, particularly in nuclear medicine as a radiotracer.

In this study, we systematically studied the acute toxicity and biodistribution of three types of MSNs with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1, 1.75 and 5 after oral administration. The effect of particle shape as a key physicochemical parameter of MSNs was discussed. With the increase of AR, MSNs showed decreased in vivo biodegradation, systematic absorption and excretion, especially decreased liver distribution and urinal excretion. During the period of urinal excretion, MSNs induced a shape-dependent renal damage including hemorrhage, vascular congestion and renal tubular necrosis. These findings will enrich the knowledge to rationally engineer bionanomaterials, and bring new insights into nanotoxicity.},

The results showed that a fraction of the SNs administrated by the intramuscular and hypodermic injection could cross different biological barriers into the liver but with a low absorption rate. Exposing by oral administration, SNs were absorbed into the intestinal tract and persisted in the liver. And SNs administrated by intravenous injection were mainly present in the liver and spleen. In addition, SNs could cause inﬂammatory response around the injection sites after intramuscular and hypodermic injection. It was also found that SNs were mainly excreted through urine and feces after different exposure routes.

For single dose toxicity, lethal dose 50 (LD50) of 110 nm MHSNs was higher than 1000 mg/kg. Further repeated dose toxicity studies indicated no death was observed when mice were exposed to MHSNs at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg by continuous intravenous administration for 14 days. These results suggest low toxicity of MHSNs when intravenous injection at single dose or repeated administrations. ICPeOES and TEM results show that the MHSNs mainly accumulate in mononuclear phagocytic cells in liver and spleen. In addition, these particles could be excreted from the body and the entire clearance time of the particles should be over 4 weeks.

Changes in morphology, size and chemical composition were determined during a 30 min exposure to synthetic human stomach ﬂuid (SSF) using Absorbance Spectroscopy, High Resolution Transmission Electron and Scanning Electron Microscopy (TEM/SEM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). AgNPs exposed to SSF were found to aggregate signiﬁcantly and also released ionic silver which physically associated with the particle aggregates as silver chloride. Generally, the smaller sized AgNPs (b10 nm) showed higher rates of aggregation and physical transformation than larger particles (75 nm). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)-stabilized AgNPs prepared in house behaved differently in SSF than particles obtained from a commercial source despite having similar surface coating and size distribution characteristics.},

SP70-induced liver injury at 30 mg/kg body weight, while SP300 or 1000 had no effect even at 100 mg/kg. Administration of SP70 dose-dependently increased serum markers of liver injury, serum aminotransferase and inﬂammatory cytokines. Repeated administration of SP70 twice a week for 4 weeks, even at 10 mg/kg, caused hepatic ﬁbrosis.

In this Full Paper, MSNs are first shown to be well tolerated, as demonstrated by serological, hematological, and histopathological examinations of blood samples and mouse tissues after MSN injection. Biodistribution studies using human cancer xenografts are carried out with in vivo imaging and fluorescent microscopy imaging, as well as with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The results show that MSNs preferentially accumulate in tumors. Finally, the drug-delivery capability of MSNs is demonstrated by following tumor growth in mice treated with camptothecin-loaded MSNs. These results indicate that MSNs are biocompatible, preferentially accumulate in tumors, and effectively deliver drugs to the tumors and suppress tumor growth.},

However, few cytotoxicity or biocompatibility studies have been reported, especially when silicates are administered in the quantities necessary to deliver low-potency drugs. The biocompatibility of mesoporous silicates of particle sizes {\textasciitilde} 150 nm, {\textasciitilde} 800 nm and {\textasciitilde} 4 µm and pore sizes of 3 nm, 7 nm and 16 nm respectively are examined here. In vitro, mesoporous silicates showed a significant degree of toxicity at high concentrations with mesothelial cells. Following subcutaneous injection of silicates in rats, the amount of residual material decreased progressively over three months, with good biocompatibility on histology at all time points. In contrast, intra peritoneal and intra venous injections in mice resulted in death or euthanasia. No toxicity was seen with subcutaneous injection of the same particles in mice. Microscopic analysis of the lung tissue of the mice indicates that death may be due to thrombosis. Although local tissue reaction to mesoporous silicates was benign, they caused severe systemic toxicity. This toxicity could be mitigated by modification of the materials.},

The lethal dose, 50 (LD50), of intravenously administrated SNPs was calculated in mice using Dixon’s up-and-down method (262.45633.78 mg/kg). The acute toxicity was evaluated at 14 d after intravenous injection of SNPs at 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg in mice. A silicon content analysis using ICP-OES found that SNPs mainly distributed in the resident macrophages of the liver (10.24\%ID/g), spleen (34.78\%ID/g) and lung (1.96\%ID/g). TEM imaging showed only a small amount in the hepatocytes of the liver and in the capillary endothelial cells of the lung and kidney. The levels of serum LDH, AST and ALT were all elevated in the SNP treated groups. A histological examination showed lymphocytic infiltration, granuloma formation, and hydropic degeneration in liver hepatocytes; megakaryocyte hyperplasia in the spleen; and pneumonemia and pulmonary interstitial thickening in the lung of the SNP treated groups. A CD68 immunohistochemistry stain indicated SNPs induced macrophage proliferation in the liver and spleen. The results suggest injuries induced by the SNPs in the liver, spleen and lungs. Mononuclear phagocytic cells played an important role in the injury process.},

As a result, injection of nSP70 caused fatal toxicity, liver damage, and platelet depletion, suggesting that nSP70 caused consumptive coagulopathy. Additionally, nSP70 exerts procoagulant activity in vitro associated with an increase in speciﬁc surface area, which increases as diameter reduces.

	abstract = {Biodegradable, controlled-release carrier materials with non-toxic degradation products are valuable for local delivery of biologically active molecules. Previously, it was shown that room-temperature processed silica sol–gels (or xerogels) are porous, resorbable materials that can release molecules of various sizes in a controlled, time dependent manner. Previous in vitro studies also demonstrated beneﬁts of silica xerogels as controlled-release materials for the treatment of bone infections. Herein the tissue and cell response to xerogels is documented using a subacute implantation procedure. The tissue response was correlated to composition, surface properties, resorption rate and incorporation of the antibiotic vancomycin. Ca- and P-free and Ca- and P-containing xerogels, with and without apatite (AP) surface, were used. Xerogels were implanted either as discs in a subcutaneous site, or as granules in the iliac crest of New Zealand white rabbits. The samples with surrounding tissue were retrieved after 2 and 4 weeks of implantation. Silica xerogels implanted either as discs subcutaneously or as granules in the iliac crest showed a favorable tissue response. The granules, either with or without Ca and P content, gradually resorbed over time. The resorption was accompanied by extensive trabecular bone growth and a minimal inﬂammatory response. Ca- and P-containing granules with an AP-surface layer showed a slower resorption rate and more extensive new bone growth than those without AP layer. Among AP-coated granules, those with incorporated vancomycin showed the most favorable tissue response. The present in vivo data together with prior in vitro data suggest that these xerogels have potential as controlled-release materials for the treatment of bone infections and as carrier materials for a variety of other applications.},

The mesoporous structures of MS and CaMS were studied by X-ray diﬀraction, transmission electron microscopy and liquid nitrogen adsorption. The results showed that the addition of Ca(NO3)2 led to the decreased cell parameters and the increased pore size of CaMS compared to MS.

	abstract = {Synthetic amorphous silica (SAS), in the form of pyrogenic (fumed), precipitated, gel or colloidal SAS, has been used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications including food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products for many decades. Based on extensive physico-chemical, ecotoxicology, toxicology, safety and epidemiology data, no environmental or health risks have been associated with these materials if produced and used under current hygiene standards and use recommendations. With internal structures in the nanoscale size range, pyrogenic, precipitated and gel SAS are typical examples of nanostructured materials as recently deﬁned by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). The manufacturing process of these SAS materials leads to aggregates of strongly (covalently) bonded or fused primary particles. Weak interaction forces (van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, physical adhesion) between aggregates lead to the formation of micrometre (␮m)-sized agglomerates. Typically, isolated nanoparticles do not occur. In contrast, colloidal SAS dispersions may contain isolated primary particles in the nano-size range which can be considered nano-objects. The size of the primary particle resulted in the materials often being considered as “nanosilica” and in the inclusion of SAS in research programmes on nanomaterials. The biological activity of SAS can be related to the particle shape and surface characteristics interfacing with the biological milieu rather than to particle size. SAS adsorbs to cellular surfaces and can affect membrane structures and integrity. Toxicity is linked to mechanisms of interactions with outer and inner cell membranes, signalling responses, and vesicle trafﬁcking pathways. Interaction with membranes may induce the release of endosomal substances, reactive oxygen species, cytokines and chemokines and thus induce inﬂammatory responses. None of the SAS forms, including colloidal nano-sized particles, were shown to bioaccumulate and all disappear within a short time from living organisms by physiological excretion mechanisms with some indications that the smaller the particle size, the faster the clearance is. Therefore, despite the new nomenclature designating SAS a nanomaterial, none of the recent available data gives any evidence for a novel, hitherto unknown mechanism of toxicity that may raise concerns with regard to human health or environmental risks.},

However, their potential vascular and systemic pathophysiologic effects are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the acute (24 hours) systemic toxicity of intraperitoneally administered 50 nm and 500 nm SiNPs in mice (0.5 mg/kg). Both sizes of SiNPs induced a platelet proaggregatory effect in pial venules and increased plasma concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen and a decrease in the number of circulating platelets were only seen following the administration of 50 nm SiNPs. The direct addition of SiNPs to untreated mouse blood significantly induced in vitro platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion, and these effects were more pronounced with 50 nm SiNPs. Both sizes of SiNPs increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and interleukin 1β concentration. ­However, tumor necrosis factor α concentration was only increased after the administration of 50 nm SiNPs. Nevertheless, plasma markers of oxidative stress, including 8-isoprostane, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase, were not affected by SiNPs. The in vitro exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to SiNPs showed a reduced cellular viability, and more potency was seen with 50 nm SiNPs. Both sizes of SiNPs caused a decrease in endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated small mesenteric arteries. We conclude that amorphous SiNPs cause systemic inflammation and coagulation events, and alter vascular reactivity. Overall, the effects observed with 50 nm SiNPs were more pronounced than those with 500 nm SiNPs. These findings provide new insight into the deleterious effect of amorphous SiNPs on vascular homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Background: Mesoporous silica (MPS) nanoparticles (NPs), which have a unique pore structure and extremely large surface area and pore volume, have received much attention because of their biomedical application potential. Using MPS NPs for biomedical devices requires the verification of their biocompatibility because the surface area of NPs is one of the most important determinants of toxicity, including the cellular uptake and immune response. We have previously reported that the cytotoxicity and inflammation potential of MPS NPs have been shown to be lower than those of general amorphous colloidal silica (Col) NPs in macrophages, but the low cytotoxicity does not guarantee high biocompatibility in vivo. In this study, we compared the in vivo immunotoxicity of MPS and Col NPs in the mouse model to define the effects of pore structural conditions of silica NPs. Materials and methods: Both MPS and Col NPs (2, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day) were intraperitoneally administered in female BALB/c mice for 4 weeks, and clinical toxicity, lymphocyte population, serum IgG/IgM levels, and histological changes were examined.
Results: There was no overt sign of clinical toxicity in either MPS- or Col-treated mice. ­However, MPS NPs led to significant increases in liver and spleen weight and splenocyte p­ roliferation. Mice treated with MPS NPs showed altered lymphocyte populations (CD3+, CD45+, CD4+, and CD8+) in the spleen, increased serum IgG and IgM levels, and histological changes. Despite slight changes in lymphocyte populations in the spleen, Col NPs did not alter other immunological factors.
Conclusion: The results indicate that in vivo exposure to MPS NPs caused more damage to systemic immunity than that of Col NPs through the dysregulation of the spleen. The results for in vivo data are inconsistent with those for in vitro data, which show lower cytotoxicity for MPS NPs. These results suggest the importance of verifying biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo during the design of new nanomaterials.},

	abstract = {Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are produced on an industrial scale and are an addition to a growing number of commercial products. SNPs also have great potential for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in medicine. Contrary to the well-studied crystalline micron-sized silica, relatively little information exists on the toxicity of its amorphous and nano-size forms. Because nanoparticles possess novel properties, kinetics and unusual bioactivity, their potential biological effects may differ greatly from those of micron-size bulk materials. In this review, we summarize the physico-chemical properties of the different nano-sized silica materials that can affect their interaction with biological systems, with a specific emphasis on inhalation exposure. We discuss recent in vitro and in vivo investigations into the toxicity of nanosilica, both crystalline and amorphous. Most of the in vitro studies of SNPs report results of cellular uptake, size- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity, increased reactive oxygen species levels and pro-inflammatory stimulation. Evidence from a limited number of in vivo studies demonstrates largely reversible lung inflammation, granuloma formation and focal emphysema, with no progressive lung fibrosis. Clearly, more research with standardized materials is needed to enable comparison of experimental data for the different forms of nanosilicas and to establish which physico-chemical properties are responsible for the observed toxicity of SNPs.},

Two widely used hydrogels, physically cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) and chemically crosslinked polyacrylamide, have been transformed to TA-based DC hydrogels by dipping the corresponding aerogels into TA solution. The second cross-link via multiple polymer−TA hydrogen bonds eﬀectively suppresses the crack propagation, resulting in both DC gels with high mechanical strength. But these two TA-based DC hydrogels go through diﬀerent deformation mechanisms during the stretching based on analyzing their stress−strain curves using the Mooney−Rivlin equation. Moreover, these DC hydrogels are swelling-resistant, with strong toughness, good self-recoverability, rapid self-healing, and versatile adhesiveness. This work provides a simple route to fabricate multifunctional DC hydrogels, hopefully promoting their applications as biomedical materials.},

	abstract = {The term “heavy metals” is used as a group name of toxic metals and metalloids (semimetals) causing contaminations and ecotoxicity. In strict chemical sense the density of heavy metals is higher than 5 g/cm3. From biological point of view as microelements they can be divided into two major groups. a. For their physiological function organisms and cells require essential microelements such as iron, chromium (III), cobalt, copper, manganese, molidenium, zinc. b. The other group of heavy metals is toxic to the health or environment. Of highest concern are the emissions of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, Tl. The toxicity of heavy metals is well known at organizational level, while less attention has been paid to their cellular effects. This book describes the toxicity of heavy metals on microorganisms, yeast, plant and animal cells. Other chapters of the book deal with their genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. The toxicity of several metals touch upon the aspects of environmental hazard, ecosystems and human health. Among the cellular responses of heavy metals irregularities in cellular mechanisms such as gene expression, protein folding, stress signaling pathways are among the most important ones. The final chapters deal with biosensors and removal of heavy metals. As everybody is eating, drinking and exposed to heavy metals on a daily basis, the spirit of the book will attract a wide audience.},

	abstract = {There has been a recent surge in the use of silver as an antimicrobial agent in a wide range of domestic and clinical products, intended to prevent or treat bacterial infections and reduce bacterial colonization of surfaces. It has been reported that the antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of silver are affected by the assay conditions, particularly the type of growth media used in vitro. The toxicity of Ag+ to bacterial cells is comparable to that of human cells. We demonstrate that biologically relevant compounds such as glutathione, cysteine and human blood components significantly reduce the toxicity of silver ions to clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria and primary human dermal fibroblasts (skin cells). Bacteria are able to grow normally in the presence of silver nitrate at .20-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) if Ag+ and thiols are added in a 1:1 ratio because the reaction of Ag+ with extracellular thiols prevents silver ions from interacting with cells. Extracellular thiols and human serum also significantly reduce the antimicrobial activity of silver wound dressings Aquacel-Ag (Convatec) and Acticoat (Smith \& Nephew) to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli in vitro. These results have important implications for the deployment of silver as an antimicrobial agent in environments exposed to biological tissue or secretions. Significant amounts of money and effort have been directed at the development of silver-coated medical devices (e.g. dressings, catheters, implants). We believe our findings are essential for the effective design and testing of antimicrobial silver coatings.},

	abstract = {Molecular weight fractions of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were obtained by catalytic degradation and characterised by theological measurements. Pseudoplastic behaviour was found in the higher molecular weight fractions, the degree of which lessened as the thermal motion of the polymer chains increased. The exponential factor of the viscosity/ molecular weight relationship indicated that the fractions were above the critical molecular weight for viscous flow determined as 15–16 000. Activation energies for viscous flow showed an inverse relationship with molecular weight, the significance of which has been discussed. Melt quenching resulted in lower melt viscosities due to a reduction in melting point by formation of additional amorphous regions. Tensile measurements indicated that PCL was a brittle material with a molecular weight of {\textgreater} 16 900 being required for free film formation. Elongation and tensile strength values increased with molecular weight although remaining low, indicating both the low molecular weight range investigated and the high degree of PCL crystallinity. PCL showed that it had rheological and tensile properties that with modification would make it a potential candidate in the novel technique of powder coating of pharmaceutical compacts.},

The ϵr and μr of the resulting polydimethylsiloxane composites are optimized for core-shell particle doping.

Current techniques for ammonia measurement suffer from limited range, poor resolution, false positives or large, complex sensor set-ups. Here we demonstrate a technique utilizing inexpensive reagents and simple methods for quantifying ammonia in 100 μL of whole blood. The sensor comprises a modiﬁed form of the indophenol reaction, which resists sources of destructive interference in blood, in conjunction with a cation-exchange membrane. The presented sensing scheme is selective against other amine containing molecules such as amino acids and has a shelf life of at least 50 days. Additionally, the resulting system has high sensitivity and allows for the accurate reliable quantiﬁcation of ammonia in whole human blood samples at a minimum range of 25 to 500 μM, which is clinically for rare hyperammonemic disorders and liver disease. Furthermore, concentrations of 50 and 100 μM ammonia could be reliably discerned with p = 0.0001.},

Poly(styrene)-block-poly(1,2-butadiene) BCPs functionalized with an acid, amine, amide, or captopril moieties were processed to produce nanopatterned films. These films were characterized using water contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy in air and liquid to determine how the modification process affected. wettability and swelling. Protein adsorption experiments were conducted under static and dynamic conditions via a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. Proteins of various size, charge, and stability were investigated to determine whether their physical characteristics affected adsorption. Significantly decreased contact angles were caused by selective swelling of modified BCP domains. The results indicate that nanopatterned chemistry and experimental conditions strongly impact adsorption dynamics. Depending on the structural stability of the protein, polyelectrolyte surfaces significantly increased adsorption over controls. Further analysis suggested that protein stability may correlate with dissipation versus frequency plots.},

	abstract = {The addition of the non-ionic surfactant, Pluronic F-68, to serum-free CHO cultures causes multifunctional effects that enhance cell yield in agitated cultures and reduce cell adhesion in stationary cultures. Three independent CHO cell lines were subjected to high liquid shear in assay systems that either included or excluded a liquid–gas interface. In the absence of Pluronic, there was a loss in cell viability in either assay system, although there was an intrinsic variability in sensitivity of the cell lines to shear damage. Supplementation with Pluronic prevented loss of cell viability, indicating protection in either a gas sparged or bubble-free environment. However, we found no evidence of long-term protection of cells once Pluronic was removed. Pluronic was capable of repairing trypsindamaged cells as evidenced by enhanced growth, reduced membrane porosity, and improved robustness under liquid shear. The proportion of adherent cells was reduced to a minimal level by the presence of Pluronic although its effect was rapidly reversible with a high proportion (70\%) of adherent cells observed within a few culture passages of its removal. The observed effects of Pluronic on these cultures are compatible with a mechanism in which the polymer forms a protective layer on the cell membrane, which has a signiﬁcantly lower hydrophobicity.},

It was found that the flexibility and degradability of the cast films of the block copolymers grew with increasing Pluronic® F68 [PN; poly(oxyethylene-co-oxypropylene] composition. The receding contact angle of the copolymer films against water became lower than that of the PLLA film, because the surface was predominantly covered with more hydrophilic PN segments in a wet state. This surface property significantly affects the cell attachment property of the copolymer films, and the fibroblasts cultured on the films exhibit a spheroid-like morphology. The copolymer films subcutaneously implanted in the back of rats induced milder tissue responses compared with PLLA homopolymers, because of the increased surface hydrophilicity in the former. In vivo evaluation using a uterus horn model in rats revealed that the performance of these copolymer films as an adhesion-prevention membrane is comparable to that of a conventionally utilized membrane of oxidized regenerated cellulose. These results indicate that the copolymer films are biocompatible materials with controllable mechanical properties and biodegradability as adhesion-prevention membranes. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Backgrounds/Aims
Major hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery is usually performed via an open method rather than a laparoscopic method. Postoperative ileus (POI) is a classic complication after open surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether polylactic film is useful in the prevention of POI.

Methods
A total of 179 patients who underwent major HPB surgery between 2005 and 2014, were retrospectively reviewed. A diagnosis of POI was made by a physical examination, laboratory, and radiological findings. Surgi-Wrap® polylactic film was preferentially used intraperitoneally by surgeons, just before wound closure.

Results
Major HPB surgery included pancreatoduodenectomy (n=48), distal or subtotal pancreatectomy (n=24), hepatectomy (n=67), other bile duct or gallbladder operations (n=35), and others (n=5). Although patients with polylactic film showed a significantly lower incidence of POI (n=3, 4.1\% vs. n=14, 13.3\%, p=0.041), they showed a significantly higher complication rate (n=20, 27.0\% vs. n=19, 18.1\%, p=0.004), particularly intra-abdominal fluid collection (n=7, 9.4\% vs. n=2, 1.9\%), and wound infections (n=6, 8.1\% vs. n=3, 2.9\%), than those who did not receive the film, respectively.

Conclusions
Although the polylactic film prevented POI, more complications other than POI were observed. Well-designed randomized controlled trials, using this anti-adhesive product, are needed to evaluate its effect on POI after major HPB surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adhesion formation is a common adverse effect in intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) surgery. Different methods of adhesion prevention have been developed, including coated meshes and separate antiadhesive barriers (SABs). In this study one type of mesh was tested with different SABs, which were fixed to the sutured mesh using fibrin sealant. The primary aim was to compare adhesion prevention between different SABs. Secondary aims were the assessment of tissue integration and evaluation of SAB fixation with fibrin sealant.
METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomized to one of three treatment groups (SurgiWrap, Prevadh and Seprafilm) or a control group (no SAB). Animals were operated on with an open IPOM technique (8 per group). One macroporous polypropylene mesh per animal (2 × 2 cm) was fixed with four non-absorbable sutures. An antiadhesive barrier of 2·5 × 2·5 cm was fixed with fibrin sealant. After 30 days, adhesion formation, tissue integration, seroma formation, inflammation and vascularization were evaluated macroscopically and by histology.
RESULTS: Prevadh and Seprafilm groups showed a significant reduction in adhesion formation compared with the control group. Tissue integration of the mesh was reduced in these groups. Fibrin sealant fixed the SAB to the mesh securely in all groups.
CONCLUSION: Prevadh and Seprafilm are potent materials for the reduction of adhesion formation. A potential relationship between effective adhesion prevention and impaired tissue integration of the implant was observed. Fibrin sealant proved an excellent agent for SAB fixation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to compare the degree of healing and air tightness of hand-sewn colonic anastomoses provided by different biological glues.
METHODS: Thirty colonic anastomoses were fashioned in ten rabbits, at 5, 10, 15 cm from the ileocecal valve, with 4/0 PDS running sutures. Each suture was randomized to treatment with fibrin sealant (Tissucol®), a synthetic glue (Coseal®), or nothing (control). After 15 days, the rabbits were killed and the anastomoses examined for their integrity and resistance to bursting. The van der Hamm scale was used to evaluate postoperative adhesions. A blind histological evaluation of the newly formed tissue was made (Ehrlich-Hunt scale).
RESULTS: Two rabbits developed an intraabdominal abscess, one in the control anastomosis group without glue. Postoperative adhesions were present in all animals. Median anastomosis bursting pressures were 0.9 atm in all three groups: Tissucol, Coseal, and control. Pressure values were 0.9, 1.0, and 0.9 atm in the three different proximodistal sites, respectively. A trend toward an increased resistance was observed in the glued anastomosis, although this was not significant. Lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast activity, blood vessel density, and collagen deposition were lower in controls. Anastomoses treated with Tissucol had the highest lymphocyte infiltration level. The Coseal group developed the highest rates of fibroblast activity, collagen deposition, and blood vessel neogenesis.
CONCLUSION: The use of biological glues did not result in a statistically significantly increased bursting resistance. Histological evaluation demonstrated more intense tissue neoformation in the glue groups, particularly in the Coseal group. The role of biological glues in decreasing the leakage rate of intestinal anastomoses is uncertain, and larger trials using different protective agents are warranted.},

In addition, next-generation sealant formulations such as active hemostatic sealant patches and bio-inspired or nanoparticle-based sealant concepts have been developed and are constantly being evaluated and refined.},

The present study compared physical, mechanical, and biologic characteristics of 4 clinically available surgical sealants for cardiovascular repair.
Methods
BioGlue (Cryolife Inc, Kennesaw, Ga), PreveLeak (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, St Louis, Mo), Tridyne VS (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Coseal (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Westlake Village, Calif) were compared for the following properties: hydrated swelling, cytocompatibility, burst strength, biaxial stretching (elasticity), and in vitro degradation.
Results
Sealants showed a wide range of swelling upon hydration. By gravimetric and volumetric measurement, swelling was greatest for Coseal followed by Tridyne VS, BioGlue, and PreveLeak. Tridyne VS was the most cytocompatible based on Alamar Blue assay results, supporting 85\% cell survival compared with 36\% to 39\% survival with the other sealants. All sealants withstood pressure above mean arterial pressure (70-110 mm Hg) and physiologic systolic blood pressure (90-140 mm Hg) in an ex vivo arterial flow burst model; lowest peak pressure at failure was PreveLeak at 235 ± 48 mm Hg, and highest peak pressure at failure was BioGlue at 596 ± 72 mm Hg. Biaxial tensile testing showed no differences in elasticity between ex vivo porcine aorta and carotid arteries and Tridyne VS or Coseal, and BioGlue and PreveLeak were significantly stiffer. In vitro degradation time for Coseal was 6 days and 21 days for Tridyne VS. No degradation was observed in BioGlue or PreveLeak for 30 days.
Conclusions
Although all sealants withstood supraphysiologic arterial pressure, there were differences in characteristics that may be important in clinical outcome. Coseal degradation time was short compared with other sealants, whereas BioGlue and PreveLeak showed a significant compliance mismatch with native porcine carotid artery. Tridyne VS was significantly more cytocompatible than the other 3 sealants.},

	issn = {0749-0712},
	abstract = {Although a substantial amount of molecular and cellular data have been generated in an effort to understand the process of wound contraction and scar contracture formation, questions remain. What seems apparent is that the myofibroblast is not the only cell that generates contractile forces within wounds, but it does appear to be intrinsically linked to the development of hypertrophic scars. The supposition that the formation of scar contractures is solely the result of a continuation of wound contraction is an oversimplification. Figure 4 provides a model of the possible evolution of contractile forces during the wound healing process and their role in the development of scar contractures. Migration of fibroblasts into and through the extracellular matrix during the initial phase of wound healing, prior to the expression of alpha-SMA, appears to be a fundamental component of wound contraction. During this migration, the pulling of collagen fibrils into a streamlined pattern in their wake, and the associated production of collagenase, may facilitate a more normal arrangement of collagen. Once the wound has been repopulated and the chemotactic gradient that was established by inflammatory cells is decreased, fibroblast migration will cease. It is at this point that myofibroblasts appear and play a key role in the production of hypertrophic scars, given that their prolonged presence and over-representation are hallmarks of this pathology. One of the pivotal differences between wounds that proceed to normal scar compared with those that develop hypertrophic scars and scar contractures may be a lack (or late induction) of myofibroblast apoptotic cell death. The combined contribution of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts to abnormal extracellular matrix protein production results in an excessive and rigid scar. The isometric application of contractile forces by myofibroblasts probably contributes to the formation of the whorls, nodules, and scar contractures characteristic of hypertrophic scars. Because the prolonged presence of myofibroblasts, producing an imbalance in extracellular matrix proteins and proteases, probably exacerbates hypertrophic scars and wound contraction, accelerating the rate of apoptotic cell death to reduce the cell number to that seen in normal scar may be a useful strategy for providing effective and efficient treatment of scar contracture.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The quantification of total collagen is of major importance in a wide range of research areas, including the study of cutaneous wound healing and new drugs trials. OBJECTIVE: The total collagen content in skin biopsies was compared by biochemical hydroxyproline assay and by two computer-aided histomorphometric analyses of histological sections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two methods were used to evaluate collagen formation: the hydroxyproline assay, as the gold standard and histomorphometric image analysis of the filled areas by corresponding stained collagen fibres, using picrosirius and Gomori's trichrome staining. The image analyses were determined by digital densitometry recognition using computer-aided ImageJ software. One-way ANOVA, simple linear regression and ANCOVA were applied for the statistical analysis and correlation. RESULTS: In a simple linear regression analysis carried out on the 14th day period after the induction of skin injury, three techniques, picrosirius red (F = 33.57, p = 0.00), Gomori's trichrome (F = 81.61, p = 0.00) and hydroxyproline content (F = 16.85, p = 0.00) were able to detect collagen production. After scale adjustment, there were no significant differences among either the slopes (F = 1.17, p = 0.32) or the intercepts (F = 0.69, p = 0.51) of the estimated regression lines. It seems that a highly significant correlation exists between the histomorphometrical analysis and hydroxyproline assay. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The morphometric analysis proved to be adequate and can be used as a simple, rapid, low-cost technology for evaluating total collagen in cutaneous wound specimens, compared with the gold standard hydroxyproline assay.},

	abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Successful treatment of wounds relies on precise control and continuous monitoring of the wound-healing process. Wet or moist treatment of wounds has been shown to promote re-epithelialization and result in reduced scar formation, as compared to treatment in a dry environment. RECENT ADVANCES: By treating wounds in a controlled wet environment, delivery of antimicrobials, analgesics, other bioactive molecules such as growth factors, as well as cells and micrografts, is allowed. The addition of growth factors or transplantation of cells yields the possibility of creating a regenerative wound microenvironment that favors healing, as opposed to excessive scar formation. CRITICAL ISSUES: Although several manufacturers have conceived products implementing the concept of moist wound healing, there remains a lack of commercial translation of wet wound-healing principles into clinically available products. This can only be mitigated by further research on the topic. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The strong evidence pointing to the favorable healing of wounds in a wet or moist environment compared to dry treatment will extend the clinical indications for this treatment. Further advances are required to elucidate by which means this microenvironment can be optimized to improve the healing outcome.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Decreased inflammatory response seen in wet wound healing may be correlated with diminished scarring. This study seeks to test this hypothesis and to validate a model of scarring in the Yorkshire pig. Four Yorkshire pigs were used to create 36 dorsal wounds per pig (144 wounds total) in the following groups: full-thickness excisional, partial thickness, meshed split-thickness skin grafts, sheet split-thickness skin grafts, minced skin, and incisional wounds. Wounds were randomized into wet and dry groups. Wet wounds were enclosed in polyurethane chambers with 2 mL of normal saline. Dry wounds were covered with regular gauze. Terminal biopsies were performed at 72 hours and day 28. Histology demonstrated significantly less inflammatory infiltrate, thicker neoepidermis, more pronounced rete ridge formation, and decreased scar tissue thickness in wet wounds. The mean macroscopic scar surface area was significantly decreased in full-thickness excisional wet wounds compared with dry wounds (61.2 mm(2) vs. 150.8 mm(2), p{\textless}0.01). Hydroxyproline content was decreased in full-thickness wet compared with dry groups (44.81 vs. 62.21 mg/g, p{\textless}0.01). Tensile strength was 90\% greater in full-thickness wet compared with dry groups (p{\textless}0.01). Healing in the liquid environment significantly reduced scar formation.

Early excision of the eschar has substantially decreased the incidence of invasive burn wound infection and secondary sepsis, but most deaths in severely burn-injured patients are still due to burn wound sepsis or complications due to inhalation injury. Burn patients are also at risk for developing sepsis secondary to pneumonia, catheter-related infections, and suppurative thrombophlebitis. The introduction of silver-impregnated devices (e.g., central lines and Foley urinary catheters) may reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections due to prolonged placement of these devices.

	abstract = {Infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms result in significant increases in mortality, morbidity, and cost related to prolonged treatments. The antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles against some drug-resistant bacteria has been established, but further investigation is needed to determine whether these particles could be an option for the treatment and prevention of drug-resistant microbial infections. Hence, we challenged different drug-resistant pathogens of clinical importance (multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli O157:H7 and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes) with a suspension of silver nanoparticles. By means of a luciferase-based assay, it was determined that silver nanoparticles (1) inactivate a panel of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative), (2) exert their antibacterial activity through a bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic mechanism, and (3) inhibit the bacterial growth rate from the time of first contact between the bacteria and the nanoparticles. Additionally, strains with a resistant phenotype to silver nanoparticle were developed and used to explore the bactericidal mode of action of silver nanoparticles. Through a Kirby–Bauer test, it was shown that silver nanoparticles’ general mechanism of bactericidal action is based on inhibition of cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis mediated by the 30s ribosomal subunit, and nucleic acid synthesis. Our data suggest that silver nanoparticles are effective broad-spectrum biocides against a variety of drug-resistant bacteria, which makes them a potential candidate for use in pharmaceutical products and medical devices that may help to prevent the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens in different clinical environments. \%9 journal article},

	abstract = {A declining pipeline of clinically useful antibiotics has made it imperative to develop more effective antimicrobial therapies, particularly against difficult-to-treat Gram-negative pathogens. Silver has been used as an antimicrobial since antiquity, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. We show that silver disrupts multiple bacterial cellular processes, including disulfide bond formation, metabolism, and iron homeostasis. These changes lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species and increased membrane permeability of Gram-negative bacteria that can potentiate the activity of a broad range of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria in different metabolic states, as well as restore antibiotic susceptibility to a resistant bacterial strain. We show both in vitro and in a mouse model of urinary tract infection that the ability of silver to induce oxidative stress can be harnessed to potentiate antibiotic activity. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in two different mouse models of peritonitis that silver sensitizes Gram-negative bacteria to the Gram-positive-specific antibiotic vancomycin, thereby expanding the antibacterial spectrum of this drug. Finally, we used silver and antibiotic combinations in vitro to eradicate bacterial persister cells, and show both in vitro and in a mouse biofilm infection model that silver can enhance antibacterial action against bacteria that produce biofilms. This work shows that silver can be used to enhance the action of existing antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, thus strengthening the antibiotic arsenal for fighting bacterial infections.},

Scanning electron micrographs show the formation of microtextured surfaces possessing re-entrant curvature; a critical feature for obtaining liquid repellency with low surface tension liquids. The surface morphology can be tuned systematically from a corpuscular or spherical microstructure to a beads-on-string structure and finally to bundled fibers by controlling the solution concentration and molecular weight of the sprayed polymer. The oleophobicity of the resulting structures is characterized by advancing and receding contact angle measurements with liquids of a range of surface tensions.},

	abstract = {Controversy over the efficacy of many topical wound treatments, particularly growth factors, is common, with many clinical practitioners still confused as to the real value of these agents. A serious lack of knowledge appears to exist concerning the diffusion and distribution of topically applied solutes in wounds. Without this basic understanding there seems little chance of accurately predicting the therapeutic window of drugs targeted at cellular activities, such as division and chemotaxis, and processes, such as collagen lattice deposition and contraction, occurring below the surface of the granulating layer. This study was designed to determine the absorption and distribution of a number of radiolabeled solutes (water, sodium chloride, lidocaine) and growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor) applied topically to full-thickness excisional wounds in rats during the early (2 d), mid (7 d), and late (12 d) stages of repair. Results showed that water and sodium penetrated deepest into wound sites and that changes in water distribution and retention in the wound paralleled the healing process. Multiple stepwise regression showed that molecular weight and tissue depth, but not day of healing, were significant factors in predicting the concentration of each solute in wound and underlying tissue sites. This finding was consistent with a tissue diffusion model developed in this study. Basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor only penetrated slightly into the upper granulating layers of the wound site, and calculation of therapeutic doses, based on the percentage of applied solute reaching the deeper granulating layers, is presented.

	abstract = {The commensal microbiota has a high impact on health and disease by modulating the development and homeostasis of host immune system. Immune cells are involved in virtually every aspect of the wound repair process; however, the impact of commensal microbiota on skin wound healing is largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the influence of commensal microbiota on tissue repair of excisional skin wounds by using germ-free (GF) Swiss mice. We observed that macroscopic wound closure rate is accelerated in the absence of commensal microbiota. Accordantly, histologically assessed wound epithelization was accelerated in GF in comparison with conventional (CV) Swiss mice. The wounds of GF mice presented a significant decrease in neutrophil accumulation and an increase in mast cell and macrophage infiltration into wounds. Interestingly, alternatively activated healing macrophage-related genes were highly expressed in the wound tissue of GF mice. Moreover, levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, the angiogenic growth factor VEGF and angiogenesis were higher in the wound tissue of those mice. Conversely, scarring and levels of the profibrogenic factor TGF-beta1 were greatly reduced in GF mice wounded skin when compared with CV mice. Of note, conventionalization of GF mice with CV microbiota restored wound closure rate, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, cytokine production, and scarring to the same extent as CV mice. Overall, our findings suggest that, in the absence of any contact with microbiota, skin wound healing is accelerated and scarless, partially because of reduced accumulation of neutrophils, increased accumulation of alternatively activated healing macrophages, and better angiogenesis at wound sites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Keloid and hypertrophic scars represent an aberrant response to the wound healing process. These scars are characterized by dysregulated growth with excessive collagen formation, and can be cosmetically and functionally disruptive to patients. OBJECTIVE: Objectives are to describe the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scar, and to compare differences with the normal wound healing process. The classification of keloids and hypertrophic scars are then discussed. Finally, various treatment options including prevention, conventional therapies, surgical therapies, and adjuvant therapies are described in detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review was performed identifying relevant publications pertaining to the pathophysiology, classification, and treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars. RESULTS: Though the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scars is not completely known, various cytokines have been implicated, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, as well as various growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor. Numerous treatments have been studied for keloid and hypertrophic scars,which include conventional therapies such as occlusive dressings, compression therapy, and steroids; surgical therapies such as excision and cryosurgery; and adjuvant and emerging therapies including radiation therapy, interferon, 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, tacrolimus, sirolimus, bleomycin, doxorubicin, transforming growth factor-beta, epidermal growth factor, verapamil, retinoic acid, tamoxifen, botulinum toxin A, onion extract, silicone-based camouflage, hydrogel scaffold, and skin tension offloading device. CONCLUSION: Keloid and hypertrophic scars remain a challenging condition, with potential cosmetic and functional consequences to patients. Several therapies exist which function through different mechanisms. Better understanding into the pathogenesis will allow for development of newer and more targeted therapies in the future.},

Normal adult human skin contains at least three distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts, which occupy unique niches in the dermis. Fibroblasts from each of these niches exhibit distinctive differences when cultured separately. Specific differences in fibroblast physiology are evident in papillary dermal fibroblasts, which reside in the superficial dermis, and reticular fibroblasts, which reside in the deep dermis. Both of these subpopulations of fibroblasts differ from the fibroblasts that are associated with hair follicles. Fibroblasts engage in fibroblast-epidermal interactions during hair development and in interfollicular regions of skin. They also play an important role in cutaneous wound repair and an ever-increasing role in bioengineering of skin. Bioengineered skin currently performs important roles in providing (1) a basic understanding of skin biology, (2) a vehicle for testing topically applied products and (3) a resource for skin replacement.},

Here, we investigated the potential toxicity of AgNPs using normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) with the aim of comparing the effects of AgNPs and ionic silver (Ag-I). Besides the effect of AgNPs and Ag-I on cell viability, the inflammatory response and DNA damage in AgNPs and Ag-I-treated cells were examined. The results showed that Ag-I were significantly more toxic than AgNPs both on NHDF and NHEK. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of AgNPs and Ag-I did not induce DNA strand breaks and did not affect inflammatory markers, except for a transient increase in interleukin 6 levels in Ag-I-treated NHDF. The results showed that AgNPs are more suitable for the intended application as a topical agent for wound healing up to the concentration 25 microg/mL.},

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a modified keratin hydrogel could reduce burn wound progression and speed healing. Standardized burn wounds were created in Yorkshire swine and treated within 30 minutes with keratin hydrogel (modified and unmodified), collagen hydrogel, or silver sulfadiazine (SSD). Digital images of each wound were taken for area measurements immediately prior to cleaning and dressing changes. Wound tissue was collected and assessed histologically at several time points. Wound area showed a significant difference between hydrogels and SSD groups, and rates of reepithelialization at early time points showed an increase when keratin treatment was used compared to both collagen and SSD. A linear regression model predicted a time to wound closure of approximately 25 days for keratin hydrogel while SSD treatment required 35 days. There appeared to be no measurable differences between the modified and unmodified formulations of keratin hydrogels.},

	abstract = {Photocrosslinkable and water soluble hyperbranched PEG-polyester polymers (HPEGDA) have been developed as robust degradable adhesives. The HPEGDA polymers have been synthesized from controlled homopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA700) via in situ deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (DE-ATRP). By introducing a high initiator-to-monomer ratio, the obtained HPEGDA polymer is composed of extremely short carbon–carbon backbones interconnected together by the long PEG chains as well as pendent photocrosslinkable acrylate moieties. Due to the extremely short C–C backbone, the long PEG chains can therefore be seen as the main chain, thus, HPEGDA polymers behave more like polyester which is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in their main chain. Photo-cured HPEGDA can be readily adhered to tissue forming a patch with robust mechanical and adhesive strengths. The degradation profile by hydrolysis of polyester blocks as well as a significantly low swelling ratio of HPEGDA gels in an aqueous environment allow them to have great potential for sealing and repair of internal tissue. Furthermore, HPEGDA gels appear to have minor significant cytotoxicity in vitro. These unique properties indicate that the reported HPEGDA polymers are well poised for the development of adhesive tissue engineering matrixes, wound dressings, and sealants.},

To overcome these drawbacks we designed a simple and scalable adhesive precursor inspired by marine mussel adhesion that functioned with strong adhesion in wet conditions and with low cytotoxicity. Dopamine, an-amine derivative of an amino acid abundantly present in mussel adhesive proteins, was co-polymerised with a tri-functional vinyl monomer, to form a hyperbranched poly(β-amino ester) polymer termed poly(dopamine-co-acrylate) (PDA). A variety of molecular weights and crosslinking methods were analysed using an ex vivo porcine skin model and an almost 4 fold increase in wet adhesion strength was observed compared to TISSEEL(®) fibrin sealant. With a fast curing time, degradable properties and low cytotoxicity, PDA is highly attractive for medical purposes and could have a broad impact on surgeries where surgical tissue adhesives, sealants, and haemostatic agents are used.},

	abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility and efficacy of a new technique for sutureless vascular anastomosis, using glued prosthesis, as a sole anastomosis fixation method in rabbits.

Methods
Ten rabbits were randomly selected to conduct the experiment. Five rabbits underwent direct anastomosis of infrarenal abdominal aorta, with glued prosthesis. In five other rabbits, reconstruction was done by sutured anastomosis. All animals were immediately examined by echo-Doppler for patency of anastomosis. The burst pressure of the glued anastomosis was measured and compared with that of a sutured artery. The animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were taken for histological examination immediately after the experiment.

Results
Compared to conventional anastomoses, sutureless vascular anastomoses required shorter time of creation and significantly reduced blood loss (P{\textless}5\%). There was no significant difference on the average blood flow through the anastomosis between two groups at the end of surgery. All anastomoses with glued prosthesis, examined by echo-Doppler, were patent at the anastomotic site, except one, which was stenosed immediately after surgery. In the control group, except one with stenosis, all conventional anastomoses were patent. Mean burst pressure at the anastomotic site for sutureless anastomoses was lower than in control group. Macroscopically, the BioGlue did not demonstrate any adhesion to the surrounding tissue as it was covered by the vascular prosthesis. Histological examination showed low-grade inflammatory reaction in glued anastomoses versus no inflammatory reaction at the sutured anastomoses.

Conclusion
This technique may provide a feasible and successful alternative in vascular surgery. However, further long-term studies are necessary to elucidate the break pressure and degree of inflammation at the anastomotic site.},

	abstract = {AIM
To evaluate the effect of local surgical adhesive glue (albumin/glutaraldehyde-Bioglue) on the healing of colonic anastomoses in rats.

METHODS
Forty Albino-Wistar male rats were randomly divided into two groups, with two subgroups of ten animals each. In the control group, an end-to-end colonic anastomosis was performed after segmental resection. In the Bioglue group, the anastomosis was protected with extraluminar application of adhesive glue containing albumin and glutaraldehyde. Half of the rats were sacrificed on the fourth and the rest on the eighth postoperative day. Anastomoses were resected and macroscopically examined. Bursting pressures were calculated and histological features were graded. Other parameters of healing, such as hydroxyproline and collagenase concentrations, were evaluated. The experimental data were summarized and computed from the results of a one-way ANOVA. Fisher’s exact test was applied to compare percentages.

RESULTS
Bursting pressures, adhesion formation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and collagen deposition were significantly higher on the fourth postoperative day in the albumin/glutaraldehyde group than in the control group. Furthermore, albumin/glutaraldehyde significantly increased adhesion formation, inflammatory cell infiltration, neoangiogenesis, and collagen deposition on the eighth postoperative day. There was no difference in fibroblast activity or hydroxyproline and collagenase concentrations.

CONCLUSION
Albumin/glutaraldehyde, when applied on colonic anastomoses, promotes their healing in rats. Therefore, the application of protective local agents in colonic anastomoses leads to better outcomes.},

Herein, we proposed a unique water-immiscible mussel protein-based bioadhesive (WIMBA) exhibiting strong underwater adhesion which was employed by two adhesion strategies of marine organisms; 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (DOPA)-mediated strong adhesion and water-immiscible coacervation. The developed biocompatible WIMBA successfully sealed ex vivo urinary fistulas and provided good durability and high compliance. Thus, WIMBA could be used as a promising sealant for urinary fistula management with further expansion to diverse internal body applications.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare mechanical strength and rheology of existing tissue adhesives in a clinically relevant test setup with regard to colorectal anastomosis.
BACKGROUND: Little is known on the mechanical strength of tissue adhesives directly after application. Furthermore, rheological profiling may be important in understanding mechanical performance and explaining differences between adhesives. This study provides new data on the mechanical strength and rheology of a comprehensive list of tissue adhesives with regard to colorectal adhesiveness.
METHODS: Twelve surgical tissue adhesives were included: 4 cyanoacrylate adhesives (CA), 2 fibrin glues (FG), 3 polyethylene glycol (PEG) adhesives, and 3 albumin-based (AB) adhesives. Tubular rat colonic segments were glued together. Tensile (T), shear (S), and peel (P) strength were measured. Shear storage (G') and shear loss (G″) moduli were also evaluated.
RESULTS: CA adhesives were stronger than AB (T: P = 0.017; S: P = 0.064; P: P {\textless} 0.001), which, in turn, were stronger than PEG (T: P {\textless} 0.001; S: P {\textless} 0.001; P: P = 0.018). PEG were stronger than FG for shear (P = 0.013) and comparable for tensile and peel strength (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Within-group variation was smallest for CA. Mechanical strength correlated strongly between performed tests. Rheological properties (G' and G″) correlated strongly with mechanical strength for all adhesives combined.
CONCLUSIONS: CA adhesives are the strongest and most homogenous group in terms of mechanical strength. Hydrogels (FG, AB) are heterogeneous, with lower mechanical strength than CA. FG are mechanically the weakest adhesives. Rheological profiles correlate to mechanical strength and may be useful for predicting mechanical performance.},

The microneedles completely dissolve after insertion into the skin for 5 min, quickly releasing their encapsulated payload into the skin. A histological examination shows that the microneedles have sufﬁcient mechanical strength to be inserted in vitro into porcine skin to a depth of approximately 200 lm and in vivo into rat skin to 200–250 lm depth. This penetration depth does not induce notable skin irritation or pain sensation. To evaluate the feasibility of using these dissolving microneedles for diabetes treatment insulin-loaded microneedles were administered to diabetic rats using a homemade applicator. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic results show a similar hypoglycemic effect in rats receiving insulin-loaded microneedles and a subcutaneous injection of insulin. The relative pharmacological availability and relative bioavailability of insulin were both approximately 92\%, demonstrating that insulin retains its pharmacological activity after encapsulation and release from the microneedles. Storage stability analysis conﬁrms that more than 90\% of the insulin remained in the microneedles even after storage at 25 or 37 °C for 1 month. These results conﬁrm that the proposed starch/gelatin microneedles enable stable encapsulation of bioactive molecules and have great potential for transdermal delivery of protein drugs in a relatively painless, rapid, and convenient manner.},

	abstract = {All animals heal, and the ability to heal is requisite for human health. One aspect of repair that has always been considered to be essential for adequate healing is the creation of a new vasculature via angiogenesis. As adult skin wounds heal, a period of rapid and robust capillary growth creates a vascular bed that has many fold more capillaries than does normal tissue. Over time, most of the newly formed capillaries regress, resulting in a final vascular density similar to that of normal skin. Certainly, new capillaries are necessary to bring nutrients, immune cells, and oxygen to healing wounds. Yet, the presumed functional importance of an overabundance of capillaries has recently been challenged, creating questions about whether excess capillary growth is truly necessary for healing. In particular, studies of wounds that heal exceptionally quickly and with less scar formation, such as those in fetal skin and oral mucosa, show that these tissues heal with a reduced angiogenic burst composed of more mature vessels that provide better oxygenation. The level of angiogenesis in wounds often correlates with the inflammatory response, largely because inflammatory cells produce an abundance of proangiogenic mediators. Both the selective reduction of inflammation and the selective reduction of angiogenesis have now been suggested as ways to improve scarring. These concepts link excessive inflammation and the production of a dense but poorly perfused capillary bed to inferior healing outcomes. J. Leukoc. Biol. 100: 979–984; 2016.},

	abstract = {Autologous cell-spray grafting of non-cultured epidermal cells is an innovative approach for the treatment of severe second-degree burns. After treatment, wounds are covered with dressings that are widely used in wound care management; however, little is known about the effects of wound dressings on individually isolated cells. The sprayed cells have to actively attach, spread, proliferate, and migrate in the wound for successful re-epithelialization, during the healing process. It is expected that exposure to wound dressing material might interfere with cell survival, attachment, and expansion. Two experiments were performed to determine whether some dressing materials have a negative impact during the early phases of wound healing. In one experiment, freshly isolated cells were seeded and cultured for one week in combination with eight different wound dressings used during burn care. Cells, which were seeded and cultured with samples of Adaptic1, Xeroform1, EZ Derm1, and Mepilex1 did not attach, nor did they survive during the ﬁrst week. Mepitel1, N-Terface1, Polyskin1, and Biobrane1 dressing samples had no negative effect on cell attachment and cell growth when compared to the controls. In a second experiment, the same dressings were exposed to pre-cultured cells in order to exclude the effects of attachment and spreading. The results conﬁrm the above ﬁndings. This study could be of interest for establishing skin cell grafting therapies in burn medicine and also for wound care in general.},

	abstract = {Collagen-based dressings are of great interest in wound care. However, evidence supporting their mechanism of action in a wound setting in vivo is scanty. This work providesfirst results from a pre-clinical swine model of excisional wounds elucidating the mechanism of action of a modified collagen gel (MCG) dressing. Following wounding, wound-edge tissue was collected at specific time intervals (3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-wounding). On day 7, histological analysis showed significant increase in the length of rete ridges suggesting improved biomechanical properties of the healing wound tissue. Rapid and transient mounting of inflammation is necessary for efficient healing. MCG significantly accelerated neutrophil and macrophages recruitment to the wound site on day 3 and day 7 with successful resolution of inflammation on day 21. MCG induced MCP-1 expression in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells in vitro. In vivo, MCG treated wound tissue displayed elevated VEGF expression. Consistently, MCG-treated wounds displayed significantly higher abundance of endothelial cells with increased blood flow to the wound area indicating improved vascularization. This observation was explained by the finding that MCG enhanced proliferation of wound-site endothelial cells. In MCG-treated wound tissue, Masson’s Trichrome and Picrosirius red staining showed higher abundance of collagen and increased collagen type I:III ratio. This work presents first evidence from a pre-clinical experimental setting explaining how a collagen-based dressing may improve wound closure by targeting multiple key mechanisms as compared to standard of care i.e., Tegadem treated wounds. The current findings warrant additional studies to determine whether the responses to the MCG are different from other modified or unmodified collagen based products used in clinical setting.},

The use of silver is increasing rapidly in the ﬁeld of wound care, and a wide variety of silver-containing dressings are now commonplace (e.g. Hydroﬁberw dressing, polyurethane foams and gauzes). However, concerns associated with the overuse of silver and the consequent emergence of bacterial resistance are being raised. The current understanding of the biochemical and molecular basis behind silver resistance has been documented since 1998. Despite the sporadic evidence of bacterial resistance to silver, there have been very few studies undertaken and documented to ascertain its prevalence. The risks of antibacterial resistance developing from the use of biocides may well have been overstated. It is proposed that hygiene should be emphasized and targeted towards those applications that have demonstrable beneﬁts in wound care. It is the purpose of this review to assess the likelihood of widespread resistance to silver and the potential for silver to induce crossresistance to antibiotics, in light of its increasing usage within the healthcare setting.},

	abstract = {Background
In the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burns, various skin substitutes and temporary dressings offer potential advantages over traditional treatments. Nonetheless, the search for an ideal temporary skin substitute or biosynthetic wound dressing is still a continuous quest. This research aimed to provide objective data on the long-term outcome of Biobrane® and Suprathel®.
Methods
Eight months after the initial burn treatment of Biobrane® and Suprathel®, skin elasticity was measured objectively using a Cutometer® and the scarring process was quantified using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS).
Results
The median healing time for patients treated with Biobrane® was up to 1.8 days shorter then the Suprathel® group. Regarding the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), neither the single parameter, nor the total score were significantly different in both groups. In comparison, the Biobrane® group demonstrated superior Cutometer® parameters in regards to maximal extension, elasticity, retraction and pliability. Despite higher levels of Biobrane® group, the differences in the viscoelastic analysis of both substitutes did not vary significantly.
Conclusion
Using both substitutes, we observed satisfying results in superficial partial-thickness burn treatment, without any significant differences. Since the treatment of burned patients is associated with high socioeconomic load, the cost factor should be one of the most important criteria in dermal substitute selection.},

For the improvement of these materials, primary goals are pain reduction and easy handling in the absence of biological risk. From a synthetic copolymer mainly based on dl-lactic acid a new skin substitute was developed, marketed as Suprathel®. Within the scope of a bicentric study Suprathel® was compared versus paraffin gauze intraindividually applied on split skin donor sites. Wound pain was measured on the Visual Pain Analog Scale over a period of 10 days as the critical criterion. Accordingly Suprathel® versus Omiderm® were compared on second degree burns (degree 2a, partial thickness burns). In both study parts, Suprathel® significantly reduced pain. Its easy handling was superior compared to other materials. The Suprathel® membrane adhered rapidly to the wound thus protecting against infections and promoting wound healing. No allergic reactions were observed. The ability of the material to resorb ensured pain-free removal after complete healing of the wound.},

	abstract = {This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing (Westaim Biomedical Corp, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. The data indicate that ACTICOAT silver had the lowest MIC and MBC and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. Viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. Mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest MICs and MBCs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after 6 hours of treatment. The results suggest that ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. ACTICOAT dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. The study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a MIC or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent or dressing.

Here we describe such an in situ forming hydrogel wound dressing from gelatin, oxidized alginate and borax. Periodate oxidized alginate rapidly cross-links proteins such as gelatin in the presence of borax to give in situ forming hydrogels that are both non-toxic and biodegradable. The composite matrix has the haemostatic effect of gelatin, the wound healing-promoting feature of alginate and the antiseptic property of borax to make it a potential wound dressing material. The hydrogel was found to have a ﬂuid uptake of 90\% of its weight which would prevent the wound bed from accumulation of exudates. The water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) of the hydrogel was found to be 26867124 g/m2/day indicating that the hydrogel can maintain a moist environment over wound bed in moderate to heavily exuding wound which would enhance epithelial cell migration during the healing process. The wound healing efﬁcacy of hydrogel was evaluated in experimental full thickness wounds using a rat model which demonstrated that within 2 weeks, the wound covered with gel was completely ﬁlled with new epithelium without any signiﬁcant adverse reactions.

One of the oldest known and most effective treatments is occlusion with silicone gel. However, little is known about its mode of action. It is hypothesized that occlusion increases the hydration state of the epidermis, and that this affects the epidermal and dermal cell behavior. This study investigated this possibility. Using the rabbit hypertrophic scar model, we determined that occlusion increased the hydration state of the epidermis in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly reduced the scar hypertrophy. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry showed that occlusion altered keratinocyte behavior, including keratin expression. Furthermore, occlusion significantly decreased the epidermal expression of the profibrotic cytokine interleukin-1b and increased the epidermal expression of the antiﬁbrotic cytokine tumor necrosis factor a. These alterations in the epidermal gene expression resulted in concomitant changes in the expression of the transforming growth factor-b family members by cells in the dermis, resulting in a decrease in profibrotic signaling within the dermis. In summary, the results of this study indicate that occlusive therapy was able to decrease dermal ﬁbrosis by hydrating the epidermis and altering the pro- and antiﬁbrotic signals produced following injury.},

	abstract = {Objective: Using Internet polling to classify characteristics of a burn wound dressing considered as ‘‘ideal’’ by burn care specialists for small sized burns ({\textless}20\% TBSA).
Methods: Open, voluntary Internet-based cross-sectional survey with twenty non-compulsory questions and collection of information related to profession, staff grade, work location.
Results: In total one-hundred and twenty-one participants from 39 countries were included (response rate: 121/1000 = 12.1\%) within the one month survey period (1–31st December 2011). The majority of respondents were surgeons (72.1\%; 88/121), and most participants were from Europe 59.4\% (72/121). According to the survey the following are the properties of an ‘‘ideal’’ burn wound dressing: non-adhesion (‘‘essential’’: 55/120, 45.8\%; ‘‘desirable’’: 50/ 120, 41.7\%), absorbency (‘‘essential’’: 41/120, 34.2\%; ‘‘desirable’’: 64/120, 53.3\%) and antimicrobial activity (‘‘essential’’: 52/121, 43.0\%; ‘‘desirable’’: 49/121, 40.5\%). In addition, ease of removal, which would produce more pain-free dressing changes, was also considered to be an asset – ideally requiring dressing changes twice per week with a range of different dressing sizes available. As polled directly, most of the respondents thought that such a dressing was currently not available.
Conclusion: This Internet-based survey provides a ﬁrst insight into a ‘wish list’ of properties for burn wound dressings required by specialists in burn care from around the world. As with any kind of idealism, to date, no such burn wound dressing seems to be available in clinical practice according to the poll. Future scientiﬁc efforts need to focus on designing materials, which feature at least some of the properties revealed by this analysis.},

	abstract = {Background. Tissue culture techniques enable in vitro expansion of keratinocytes that can be used to treat burns and chronic wounds. These keratinocytes are commonly grafted onto the wounds as differentiated sheets of mature epithelium. Less is however known about the effects of transplanting the cells as suspensions. This study evaluated epidermal regeneration in fluid-treated skin wounds treated with suspensions of cultured and noncultured autologous keratinocytes. Materials and methods. Eighty-seven full-thickness excisional skin wounds were created on the back of 6 pigs and then transplanted with either cultured or noncultured autologous keratinocytes. The wounds were enclosed with liquid-tight chambers containing saline to provide a hydrated and standardized environment. Results. Keratinocyte transplantation resulted in several cell colonies within the granulation tissue of the wound. These colonies progressively coalesced and contributed to a new epithelium. The origin of the transplanted keratinocytes was confirmed by histochemical staining of wounds transplanted with transfected keratinocytes expressing β-galactosidase. Transplantation of 0.125 × 106, 0.5 × 106, and 2.0 × 106 cultured keratinocytes, and 0.5 × 106 and 5.0 × 106 noncultured keratinocytes, increased reepithelialization dose dependently over saline-treated controls. The epithelial barrier function recovered faster in transplanted wounds as demonstrated by less protein leakage over the wound surface on Days 7–10 as compared to control wounds. Wound reepithelialization and the number of keratinocyte colonies observed in granulation tissue were significantly less in wounds transplanted with noncultured keratinocytes compared to wounds seeded with cultured keratinocytes. Conclusion. Our study demonstrates successful transplantation of keratinocyte suspensions and their dose-dependent acceleration of wound repair. Selection of proliferative cells during culture and higher colony-forming efficiency may explain the greater effects observed with cultured keratinocytes.},

	abstract = {Aim
The aim was to review the use and indications of cultured autologous epidermis (CAE) in extensive burns and to evaluate the efficiency of our strategy of burn treatment.
Materials and methods
This retrospective study comprised 15 years (1997–2012). Inclusion criteria: all patients who received CAE. Exclusion criteria: patients who died before complete healing and patients who received exclusively cultured allogeneic keratinocytes. Evaluation criteria were clinical. Time and success of wound healing after CAE graft were evaluated.
Results
A total of 63 patients were included with severity Baux score of 107 (from 70 to 140) and mean percentage of TBSA of 71\% (from 40\% to 97\%). The CAE were used as Cuono method, in STSG donor sites and deep 2nd degree burns and in combination with large-meshed STSG (1:6–1:12) in extensively burned patients. Cuono method was used in 6 patients. The final take was 16\% (0–30) because of the great fragility of the obtained epidermis. Nine patients with deep 2nd degree burns (mean TBSA 81\%, from 60 to 97\%) were successfully treated with only CAE without skin grafting. Combined technique (STSG meshed at 1:6–1:12 covered with CAE) was used in 27 patients (mean TBSA 69\%, from 49\% to 96\%) with 85\% success rate. Finally, donor sites treated with CAE in 49 patients could be harvested several times thanks to rapid epithelialization (time of wound healing was 7 days (from 5 to 10 days)).
Conclusion
The CAE allow rapid healing of STSG donor sites and deep 2nd second degree burns in extensively burned patients.},

	issn = {1943-2704},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ReCell (Avita Medical, Northridge, CA) is an autologous cell harvesting (ACH) device that enables a thin split-thickness skin biopsy to be processed to produce a cell population that includes a mixed population of keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and papillary dermal fibroblasts for immediate delivery via a spray applicator onto a prepared skin surface.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this Institutional Review Board-approved US Food and Drug Administration phase 2 study, the authors prospectively evaluated the treatment of partial-thickness burns in patients with two 320 cm2 areas, 1 area treated with the ACH device and the other with a meshed split-thickness skin graft (MSTSG) as a control. The authors compared the treatment areas for graft take, pigmentation, and color match to surrounding healthy tissue, scarring, and pain.
RESULTS: In this preliminary study, 10 patients were treated with this protocol. Eight patients had 100\% take to both treatment areas and 2 patients had significant non-take and graft loss attributable to underexcised wound beds and difficulty with the spray applicator. Pigmentation and color match ratings were identical at week 52 and the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale scores were comparable. One subject rated the autologous cell harvesting site as having a better appearance, while the remaining subjects rated their ACH and MSTSG sites' appearances as being comparable. In early follow-up visits, pain ratings were slightly elevated in the ACH group due to graft healing; however, in visits following week 2, pain ratings at the ACH and MSTSG sites were rated similarly by all patients.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary report describes an early experience with the ACH device and the treatment of partial-thickness burn injuries. In this 10-patient series, patients benefitted from having a decreased donor site size and comparable outcomes with MSTSG treatment. While this preliminary underpowered study has provided positive results, there is a learning curve with choosing the proper wound for treatment with the ACH device, as well as with using the device.},

Methods: Retrospective analysis of theatre records, medical notes, and photography database to categorize our experience with Biobrane. Thorough assessment of our surgical and nursing protocols (both literature and experience influenced) to identify caveats for successful use. Results: Pivotal steps are revealed in wound selection, wound preparation, material application, dressing, and subsequent nursing care that have led to overwhelming success in definitive management of superficial partial thickness to middermal burns (ensuring pain relief, allowing early mobilization, tolerance of dressing changes and therapy, and earlier hospital discharge). Its many uses in a broad range of common burn situations are demonstrated and tips provided to achieve best outcome. Conclusions: Biobrane is not a panacea but it is extremely versatile. The different potential uses have learning curves, and suggestions are provided to flatten these.},

	abstract = {Background
Artificial dermal templates play an important role in physiologic wound closure after injury. In addition to contributing to stable, durable and flexible wound closure, they provide a scaffold for tissue repair. Several dermal templates are commercially available, with animal-derived Integra® dermal regeneration template perhaps the most widely used. NovoSorb™ Biodegradable Temporising Matrix (BTM) is a fully synthetic alternative that eliminates any risk of cross-species residual antigenicity. In this study, we aimed to compare early response after application of NovoSorb™ BTM with Integra® in terms of temporary wound closure, host cell infiltration, neovascularisation and collagen deposition in a mouse model.
Methods
Twenty athymic nude mice received full-thickness skin excision followed by grafting of the dermal template (n=10 NovoSorb™ BTM, n=10 Integra®), with the grafts excised and assessed after two weeks.
Results
All twenty mice achieved temporary wound closure with no evidence of wound contracture. Microscopically, all twenty grafts became infiltrated with host cells along the entire length of the template, with NovoSorb™ BTM demonstrating a particular abundance of host inflammatory cells. Evidence of new collagen deposition and neovascularisation was observed in both templates, with NovoSorb™ BTM demonstrating a more extensive vascular network at this time point. However, a greater inflammatory response was also observed in the NovoSorb™ BTM grafts at this time point.
Conclusions
In this study, NovoSorb™ BTM demonstrates favourable properties as a dermal template, but further investigation is required to assess the significance of the differing inflammatory and vascular response to its implantation compared with Integra®.},

Patients under 18 years of age with intermediate thickness burns on a surface area less than 10\% were enrolled and treated with one of the two dressing systems. Data collected included mechanism of injury, time to complete healing, pain scores, and institutional cost of materials until healing was complete. No significant difference in time to healing or pain scores was detected between the two groups. The cost of each treatment was statistically more expensive in the Biobrane® group. The results of this study demonstrate that Duoderm® and Biobrane® provide equally effective treatment of partial thickness burns among in the pediatric population. However, Duoderm® is statistically less expensive than Biobrane® and can be considered a first-line treatment option for intermediate thickness burn wounds in children.},

	abstract = {Many new dressings have been introduced for use on split-thickness skin graft donor sites in an effort to reduce pain at the donor site and decrease healing time, while maintaining a low infection rate and cost. To assess these factors in two such dressings, Biobrane (temporary wound dressing) (Winthrop) and Duoderm (hydrocolloid dressing) (Convatec), we compared them with a conventional fine mesh gauze dressing, xeroform, in a prospective, randomized study of 30 donor sites in the same number of patients. Wounds were considered healed when they were 100 per cent re-epithelialized and required no further dressings. Patient self-assessment of pain was quantified on a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the most severe pain. Donor sites dressed with xeroform had a healing time of 10.5 days, which was significantly better (p less than 0.05) than Duoderm (15.3 days) or Biobrane (19.0 days), although the protocol for Duoderm use (wound visualization at seven day intervals) extended the apparent healing times in this group. Duoderm was the most comfortable dressing (0.53 grade) when compared with Biobrane (1.44) and xeroform (2.41, p less than 0.05). No infections occurred in donor sites dressed with xeroform, but two developed in patients using Biobrane. One patient with a Duoderm dressing had a donor site infection during a drug-related neutropenic reaction. Xeroform was the least expensive dressing to use (\$1.16 per patient), followed by Duoderm (\$54.88 per patient) and Biobrane (\$102.57 per patient). The results of our study confirm the usefulness of xeroform as a donor site dressing as it promotes relatively rapid healing, is easy to use and is inexpensive. We found Duoderm to be ideal for smaller donor sites when pain could be significantly reduced with minimal increase in cost. Biobrane is too costly and the infection rate too high for it to be used routinely as a skin graft donor site dressing.},

However, electron microscopy showed rFI produced ﬁbrin with much thicker ﬁbers with less branching than pdFI. In vivo studies in a swine liver transection model showed that, relative to pdFI, rFI made a denser, more strongly wound-adherent ﬁbrin clot that more rapidly established hemostasis.},

	abstract = {Background: Applications of plasma-derived human ﬁbrin sealants (pdhFS) have been limited because of cost, limited supply of pathogen-screened plasma, the need for bioengineering improvements, and regulatory issues associated with federal approval. We describe a totally recombinant human ﬁbrin sealant (rhFS), which may engender an abundant, safe, and cost-effective supply of efﬁcacious ﬁbrin sealant. Materials and methods: A ﬁrst-generation rhFS made from recombinant human ﬁbrinogen (rhFI; produced in the milk of transgenic cows), activated recombinant human factor XIII (rhFXIIIa; produced in yeast), and recombinant human thrombin (rhFIIa; purchased, made in animal cell culture) was formulated using thromboelastography (TEG). The hemostatic efﬁcacy of rhFS versus commercial pdhFS was compared in a nonlethal porcine hepatic wedge excision model.
Results: The maximal clot strength of rhFS measured in vitro by TEG was not statistically different than that of pdhFS. TEG analysis also showed that the rhFS gained strength more quickly as reﬂected by a steeper a angle; however, the rhFS achieved this clot strength with a 5-fold lower factor I content than the pdhFS. When these ﬁbrin sealants were studied in a porcine hepatic wedge excision model, the hemostatic scores of the rhFS were equivalent or better than that of the pdhFS.
Conclusions: The bioengineered rhFS had equivalent or better hemostatic efﬁcacy than the pdhFS in a nonlethal hemorrhage model, despite the factor I concentration in the rhFS being about one-ﬁfth that in the pdhFS. Because the rhFS is amenable to large-scale production, the rhFS has the potential to be more economical and abundant than the pdhFS, while having a decreased risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The main functions of biological adhesives and sealants are to repair injured tissues, reinforce surgical wounds, or even replace common suturing techniques. In general surgery, adhesives must match several requirements taking into account clinical needs, biological effects, and material features; these requirements can be fulfilled by specific polymers. Natural or synthetic polymeric materials can be employed to generate three-dimensional networks that physically or chemically bind to the target tissues and act as hemostats, sealants, or adhesives. Among them, fibrin, gelatin, dextran, chitosan, cyanoacrylates, polyethylene glycol, and polyurethanes are the most important components of these interfaces; various aspects regarding their adhesion mechanisms, mechanical performance, and resistance to body fluids should be taken into account to choose the most suitable formulation for the target application. This review aims to describe the main adhesives and sealant materials for general surgery applications developed in the past decades and to highlight the most important aspects for the development of future formulations.

Methods: Products selected and reviewed reflect historical precedence and importance and focus on current clinically available products in use. Emerging technologies we anticipate will further expand our therapeutic options are introduced. The topic of tissue engineering is incredibly broad in scope, and as such the authors have focused their review on that of constructs specifically designed for skin and wound healing. A review of pertinent and current clinically related literature is included.
Results: Products such as biosynthetics, biologics, cellular promoting factors, and commercially available matrices can be routinely found in most modern health care centers. Although to date no complete regenerative or direct identical soft-tissue replacement exists, currently available commercial components have proven beneficial in augmenting and improving some types of wound healing scenarios. Cost, directed specificity, biocompatibility, and bioburden tolerance are just some of the impending challenges to adoption.
Conclusions: Quality of life and in fact the ability to sustain life is dependent on our most complex and remarkable organ, skin. Although pure regenerative healing and engineered soft-tissue constructs elude us, surgeons and health care providers are slowly gaining comfort and experience with concepts and strategies to improve the healing of wounds.  (Plast.

The results of experimental work reported during the last 5 years, clinical data from the same period and the safety aspects of fibrin-based glues and sealants are summarized, showing many advantages of their clinical application over the use of synthetic glues or sealants that may be stronger in some cases, but less safe.

	abstract = {Traditional electrospun nanoﬁber membranes were incapable of promoting cellular inﬁltration due to its intrinsic property (e.g., dense structure and small pore size) limiting their use in tissue regeneration. Herein, we report a simple and novel approach for expanding traditional nanoﬁber membranes from two-dimensional to three-dimensional (3D) with controlled thickness and porosity via depressurization of subcritical CO2 ﬂuid. The expanded 3D nanoﬁber scaffolds formed layered structures and simultaneously maintained the aligned nanotopographic cues. The 3D scaffolds also retained the ﬂuorescent intensity of encapsulated coumarin 6 and the antibacterial activity of encapsulated antimicrobial peptide LL-37. In addition, the expanded 3D nanoﬁber scaffolds with arrayed holes can signiﬁcantly promote cellular inﬁltration and neotissue formation after subcutaneous implantation compared to traditional nanoﬁber membranes. Such scaffolds also signiﬁcantly increased the blood vessel formation and the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages after subcutaneous implantation for 2 and 4 weeks compared to traditional nanoﬁber membranes. Together, the presented method holds great potential in the fabrication of functional 3D nanoﬁber scaffolds for various applications including engineering 3D in vitro tissue models, antimicrobial wound dressing, and repairing/regenerating tissues in vivo.},

	abstract = {Extracellular proteins play a key role in generating and maintaining cohesion and adhesion in biological tissues. These ‘‘natural glues’’ are involved in vital biological processes such as blood clotting, wound healing and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Macromolecular assemblies of proteins can be functionally stabilized in a variety of ways in situ that include ionic interactions as well as covalent crosslinking to form protein networks that can extend both within and between tissues. Within tissues, myriad cohesive forces are required to preserve tissue integrity and function, as are additional appropriate adhesive forces at interfaces both within and between tissues of differing composition. While the mechanics of some key structural adhesive proteins have been characterized in tensile experiments at both the macroscopic and single protein levels, the fracture toughness of thin proteinaceous interfaces has never been directly measured. Here, we describe a novel and simple approach to measure the cohesive behavior and toughness of thin layers of proteinaceous adhesives. The test is based on the standard double-cantilever beam test used for engineering adhesives, which was adapted to take into account the high compliance of the interface compared with the beams. This new ‘‘rigid double-cantilever beam’’ method enables stable crack propagation through an interfacial protein layer, and provides a direct way to measure its full traction–separation curve. The method does not require any assumption of the shape of the cohesive law, and the results provide abundant information contributing to understanding the structural, chemical and molecular mechanisms acting in biological adhesion. As an example, results are presented using this method for thin ﬁlms of ﬁbrin—a protein involved in blood clotting and used clinically as a tissue bio-adhesive after surgery—with the effects of calcium and crosslinking by Factor XIII being examined. Finally, a simple model is proposed, demonstrating how a bell-shaped cohesive law forms during the failure of the ﬁbrin interface based on an eight-chain model whose structure degrades and changes conﬁguration with stress.},

	abstract = {Background: Reduction of perioperative blood loss and intraoperative transfusion are two major factors associated with improving outcomes in liver surgery. There is currently no consensus as to the best technique to achieve this.
Methods: An international Panel of Experts (EP), made up of hepatobiliary surgeons from well-known high-volume centres was assembled to share their experience with regard to the management of blood loss during liver resection surgery. The process included: a review of the current literature by the panel, a face-to-face meeting and an on-line survey completed by the EP prior to and following the face-to-face meeting, based on predetermined case scenarios. During the meeting the most frequently researched surgical techniques were appraised by the EP in terms of intraoperative blood loss.
Results: All EP members agreed that high quality research on the subject was lacking. Following an agreed risk stratiﬁcation algorithm, the EP concurred with the existing research that a haemostatic device should always be used along with any user preferred surgical instrumentation in both open and laparoscopic liver resection procedures, independently from stratiﬁcation of bleeding risk. The combined use of Ultrasonic Dissector (UD) and saline-coupled bipolar sealing device (AquamantysÒ) was the EP preferred technique for both open and laparoscopic surgery.
Conclusions: This EP propose the use of a bipolar sealer and UD for the best resection technique and essential equipment to minimise blood loss during liver surgery, stratiﬁed according to transfusion risk, in both open and laparoscopic liver resection. Ó 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although immunotherapy shows great promise for the long-term control of cancer, many tumors still fail to respond to treatment. To improve the outcome, the delivery of immunostimulants to the lymph nodes draining the tumor, where the antitumor immune response is initiated, is key. Efforts to use nanoparticles as carriers for cancer immunotherapy have generally required targeting agents and chemical modification of the drug, and have unfortunately resulted in low delivery and therapeutic efficiency. Here, we report on the efficacy of gold nanoparticles with approximately 5 nm hydrodynamic diameter coated with a mixture of 1-octanethiol and 11mercaptoundecanesulfonic acid for the delivery of an immunostimulatory TLR7 ligand to tumor-draining lymph nodes. The drug was loaded without modification through nonspecific adsorption into the ligand shell of the nanoparticles, taking advantage of their amphiphilic nature. After loading, nanoparticles retained their stability in solution without significant premature release of the drug, and the drug cargo was immunologically active. Upon subcutaneous injection into tumor-bearing mice, the drug-loaded particles were rapidly transported to the tumor-draining lymph nodes. There, they induced a local immune activation and fostered a cytotoxic T-cell response that was specific for the tumor. Importantly, the particle-delivered TLR7 ligand blocked the growth of large established tumors and significantly prolonged survival compared to the free form of the drug. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that nanoparticle delivery of a TLR7 immunostimulant to the tumor-draining lymph nodes enhances antitumor immunity and improves the outcome of cancer immunotherapy.},

Although chitosan dressings have been developed to address these problems, they are not always effective in controlling bleeding or killing bacteria. We aimed to refine the chitosan dressing by incorporating a procoagulant (polyphosphate) and an antimicrobial (silver). Chitosan containing different amounts and types of polyphosphate polymers was fabricated, and their hemostatic efficacies evaluated in vitro. The optimal chitosan-polyphosphate formulation (ChiPP) accelerated blood clotting (p = 0.011), increased platelet adhesion (p=0.002), generated thrombin faster (p = 0.002), and absorbed more blood than chitosan (p {\textless} 0.001). Silver-loaded ChiPP exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than ChiPP in vitro, achieving a complete kill of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a {\textgreater} 99.99\% kill of Staphylococcus aureus consistently. The silver dressing also significantly reduced mortality from 90\% to 14.3\% in a P. aeruginosa wound infection model in mice. Although the dressing exerted severe cytotoxicity against cultured fibroblasts, wound healing was not inhibited. This study demonstrated for the first time, the application of polyphosphate as a hemostatic adjuvant, and developed a new chitosan-based composite with potent hemostatic and antimicrobial properties.},

	abstract = {Adipose tissue can undergo rapid expansion during times of excess caloric intake. Like a rapidly expanding tumor mass, obese adipose tissue becomes hypoxic due to the inability of the vasculature to keep pace with tissue growth. Consequently, during the early stages of obesity, hypoxic conditions cause an increase in the level of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) expression. Using a transgenic model of overexpression of a constitutively active form of HIF1alpha, we determined that HIF1alpha fails to induce the expected proangiogenic response. In contrast, we observed that HIF1alpha initiates adipose tissue fibrosis, with an associated increase in local inflammation. "Trichrome- and picrosirius red-positive streaks," enriched in fibrillar collagens, are a hallmark of adipose tissue suffering from the early stages of hypoxia-induced fibrosis. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a transcriptional target of HIF1alpha and acts by cross-linking collagen I and III to form the fibrillar collagen fibers. Inhibition of LOX activity by beta-aminoproprionitrile treatment results in a significant improvement in several metabolic parameters and further reduces local adipose tissue inflammation. Collectively, our observations are consistent with a model in which adipose tissue hypoxia serves as an early upstream initiator for adipose tissue dysfunction by inducing a local state of fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Integra((R)) matrix wound dressing (MWD) is used for the reconstruction of full-thickness skin defects. For the treatment of complex wounds, this dermal substitute is available as a flowable wound matrix (FWM) of identical composition. To clarify whether variations in sample preparation and consistency affect the biocompatibility and tissue incorporation, we herein compared MWD and FWM. The matrices were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and histology. Moreover, they were implanted in mouse dorsal skinfold chambers to analyze their in vivo performance over 2 weeks. Scanning electron microscopy showed a planar surface of MWD whereas FWM presented an irregular, fissured morphology. However, histology of the two matrices revealed an identical fiber thickness, fiber length, and interfiber distance. Repetitive stereo-microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses of MWD and FWM showed a comparable epithelialization of the implants in the dorsal skinfold chamber model. At day 14, both matrices exhibited a low collagen content and microvessel density. Moreover, they were infiltrated by a high number of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive neutrophilic granulocytes and a lower number of MAC387-positive macrophages and CD3-positive lymphocytes. These findings demonstrate that differences in preparation and consistency do not affect the tissue response to MWD and FWM, indicating a comparable regenerative capacity in wound healing.

Nanofibrous PLA scaffolds containing 10, 20, or 30 wt \% ibuprofen were created and ibuprofen release profiles quantified. In vitro cytotoxicity to human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) of the three scaffolds with varying ibuprofen concentrations were evaluated and compared to pure PLA nanofibrous scaffolds. Thereafter, scaffolds loaded with ibuprofen at the concentration that promoted human skin cell viability and proliferation (20 wt \%) were evaluated in vivo in nude mice using a full thickness skin incision model to determine the ability of these scaffolds to promote skin regeneration and/or assist with scarless healing. Both acellular and HEK and HDF cell-seeded 20 wt \% ibuprofen loaded nanofibrous bandages reduced wound contraction compared with wounds treated with Tegaderm and sterile gauze. Newly regenerated skin on wounds treated with cell-seeded 20 wt \% ibuprofen bandages exhibited significantly greater blood vessel formation relative to acellular ibuprofen bandages. We have found that degradable anti-inflammatory scaffolds containing 20 wt \% ibuprofen promote human skin cell viability and proliferation in vitro, reduce wound contraction in vivo, and when seeded with skin cells, also enhance new blood vessel formation. The approaches and results reported here hold promise for multiple skin tissue engineering and wound healing applications. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Wound healing is an incredibly complex biological process that often results in thickened collagen-enriched healed tissue called scar. Cutaneous scars lack many functional structures of the skin such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and papillae. The absence of these structures contributes to a number of the long-term morbidities of wound healing, including loss of function for tissues, increased risk of re-injury, and aesthetic complications. Scar formation is a pervasive factor in our daily lives; however, in the case of serious traumatic injury, scars can create long-lasting complications due to contraction and poor tissue remodeling. Within this report we target the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a key mediator of TGFbeta pro-fibrotic response in cutaneous wound healing, with controlled local delivery of RNA interference. Through this work we describe both a thorough in vitro analysis of nanolayer coated sutures for the controlled delivery of siRNA and its application to improve scar outcomes in a third-degree burn induced scar model in rats. We demonstrate that the knockdown of CTGF significantly altered the local expression of alphaSMA, TIMP1, and Col1a1, which are known to play roles in scar formation. The knockdown of CTGF within the healing burn wounds resulted in improved tissue remodeling, reduced scar contraction, and the regeneration of papillary structures within the healing tissue. This work adds support to a number of previous reports that indicate CTGF as a potential therapeutic target for fibrosis. Additionally, we believe that the controlled local delivery of siRNA from ultrathin polymer coatings described within this work is a promising approach in RNA interference that could be applied in developing improved cancer therapies, regenerative medicine, and fundamental scientific research.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented increase in antibiotic resistance in this era has resuscitated the attention of scientific community to exploit silver and its various species as antimicrobial agents. Plenty of studies have been done to measure the antimicrobial potential of silver species (cationic silver, metallic Ag(0) or silver nanoparticles, silver oxide particulates etc.) and indicated that membrane damage, oxidative stress, protein dysfunction and DNA damage to be the possible cause of injury to the microbial cell. However, the precise molecular mechanism of their mode of action has remained unclear, which makes an obstacle towards the generation of potential antibacterial agent against various pathogenic and multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. In order to endeavor this issue, one should first have the complete understanding about the resistance mechanisms present in bacteria that can be a therapeutic target for the silver-based drug formulations. Apart from this, in-depth understanding of the interactions of various silver species (with the biological media) is a probable deciding factor for the synthesis of silver-based drug formulations because the particular form and physico-chemical properties of silver can ultimately decide their antimicrobial action. In context to above mentioned serious concerns, the present article aims to discuss the mechanisms behind the confrontation of bacteria against various drugs and the effect of physico-chemical properties of silver species on their bactericidal action as well as critically evaluates the available reports on bacterial transcriptomic and proteomic profiles upon the exposure of various silver species. Further, this review state the mechanism of action that needs to be followed for the complete understanding of toxic potential of silver nanoparticles, which will open a possibility to synthesize new silver nanoparticle based antimicrobial systems with desired properties to ensure their safe use, exposure over extended period and fate in human body and environment.},

Widespread skin and tissue damage causes release of systemic inflammatory mediators that promote endothelial leak, extravascular fluid shifts, and cardiovascular derangement. This phase is characterized by relative intra-vascular hypovolaemia and poor peripheral perfusion. Large volume intravenous fluid resuscitation is generally required. The patients' clinical course is then typically complicated by ongoing inflammation, protein catabolism, and marked haemodynamic perturbation. At all times, drug distribution, metabolism, and elimination are grossly distorted. For hydrophilic agents, changes in volume of distribution and clearance are marked, resulting in potentially sub-optimal drug exposure. In the case of antibiotics, this may then promote treatment failure, or the development of bacterial drug resistance. As such, empirical dose selection and pharmaceutical development must consider these features, with the application of strategies that attempt to counter the unique pharmacokinetic changes encountered in this setting.},

	abstract = {According to the latest report from the World Health Organization, an estimated 265,000 deaths still occur every year as a direct result of burn injuries. A widespread range of these deaths induced by burn wound happens in low- and middle-income countries, where survivors face a lifetime of morbidity. Most of the deaths occur due to infections when a high percentage of the external regions of the body area is affected. Microbial nutrient availability, skin barrier disruption, and vascular supply destruction in burn injuries as well as systemic immunosuppression are important parameters that cause burns to be susceptible to infections. Topical antimicrobials and dressings are generally employed to inhibit burn infections followed by a burn wound therapy, because systemic antibiotics have problems in reaching the infected site, coupled with increasing microbial drug resistance. Nanotechnology has provided a range of molecular designed nanostructures (NS) that can be used in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in burns. These NSs can be divided into organic and non-organic (such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and silver NPs, respectively), and many have been designed to display multifunctional activity. The present review covers the physiology of skin, burn classification, burn wound pathogenesis, animal models of burn wound infection, and various topical therapeutic approaches designed to combat infection and stimulate healing. These include biological based approaches (e.g. immune-based antimicrobial molecules, therapeutic microorganisms, antimicrobial agents, etc.), antimicrobial photo- and ultrasound-therapy, as well as nanotechnology-based wound healing approaches as a revolutionizing area. Thus, we focus on organic and non-organic NSs designed to deliver growth factors to burned skin, and scaffolds, dressings, etc. for exogenous stem cells to aid skin regeneration. Eventually, recent breakthroughs and technologies with substantial potentials in tissue regeneration and skin wound therapy (that are as the basis of burn wound therapies) are briefly taken into consideration including 3D-printing, cell-imprinted substrates, nano-architectured surfaces, and novel gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas.},

Current approaches to manage scarring include surgical techniques and non-surgical methods such as laser therapy, steroid injections, and compression therapy. These treatments are limited in their effectiveness and regularly fail to manage symptoms. As a result, the development of novel treatments that aim to improve outcomes and quality of life is imperative. Drug delivery that targets the molecular cascades of wound healing to attenuate or prevent hypertrophic scarring is a promising approach that has therapeutic potential. In this review, we discuss current treatments for scar management after burn injury, and how drug delivery targeting molecular signaling can lead to new therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {All vertebrates possess mechanisms to restore damaged tissues with outcomes ranging from regeneration to scarring. Unfortunately, the mammalian response to tissue injury most often culminates in scar formation. Accounting for nearly 45\% of deaths in the developed world, fibrosis is a process that stands diametrically opposed to functional tissue regeneration. Strategies to improve wound healing outcomes therefore require methods to limit fibrosis. Wound healing is guided by precise spatiotemporal deposition and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM, comprising the non-cellular component of tissues, is a signalling depot that is differentially regulated in scarring and regenerative healing. This Review focuses on the importance of the native matrix components during mammalian wound healing alongside a comparison to scar-free healing and then presents an overview of matrix-based strategies that attempt to exploit the role of the ECM to improve wound healing outcomes.},

We discuss the significant challenges faced by patients and healthcare providers alike in treating these wounds. New state of the art technologies have provided remarkable insights into the role of skin stem and progenitor cells and their niches in maintaining skin homeostasis and in reparative wound healing. Based on this knowledge, we examine different approaches to repair extensive burn injury and chronic wounds, including full and split thickness skin grafts, temporising matrices and scaffolds, and composite cultured skin products. Notable developments include next generation skin substitutes to replace split thickness skin autografts and next generation gene editing coupled with cell therapies to treat genodermatoses. Further refinements are predicted with the advent of bioprinting technologies, and newly defined biomaterials and autologous cell sources that can be engineered to more accurately replicate human skin architecture, function and cosmesis. These advances will undoubtedly improve quality of life for patients with extensive burns and difficult to heal wounds.},

All microscopy methods investigated resolved the time-dependent dynamics of collagen deposition in scar tissue during skin wound healing in rats. Collagen content measured by Sirius red/PL-PC and Sirius red/PL-CS was significantly lower when compared with Trichrome/PC. The Trichrome/PC method provided overestimated values of collagen compared with biochemical analysis. In the early stages of wound healing, which shows high production of noncollagenous molecules, Sirius red/PL-CS and Sirius red/PL-PC methods were more suitable for quantification of collagen fibers.

As developed by Junqueira and colleagues in 1979, specific staining by Picrosirius red is one of the most important stains to study collagen networks in different tissues. Under polarized light, collagen bundles appear green, red or yellow, and are easily differentiated from the black background, thus allowing for quantitative morphometric analysis. As Junqueira and colleagues point out, many studies use color staining to differentiate collagen bundles and to specify collagen types, yet other studies report that polarized colors only reflect fiber thickness and packing. Using a simple histological example, our study illustrates the inability of Picrosirius red staining to differentiate collagen types, since the absorbed amount of polarized light by this dye strictly depends on the orientation of the collagen bundles.},

However, if a wound dressing strongly adheres to the wound, a large amount of stratum corneum is removed from the newly formed epithelium or healthy periwound skin. Various types of adhesives are used on adhesive wound dressings and the extent of skin damage depends on how much an adhesive sticks to the wound or skin surface. We quantitatively determined and compared the amount of stratum corneum removed by eight different wound dressings including polyurethane foam using acrylic adhesive, silicone-based adhesive dressing, composite hydrocolloid and self-adhesive polyurethane foam in healthy volunteers. The results showed that wound dressings with silicone adhesive and self-adhesive polyurethane foam removed less stratum corneum, whereas composite hydrocolloid and polyurethane foam using acrylic adhesive removed more stratum corneum.},

	abstract = {Biodegradable polymeric materials are ideal carrier systems for biomedical applications. Features like controlled and sustained delivery, improved drug pharmacokinetics, reduced side effects and safe degradation make the use of these materials very attractive in a lot of medical fields, with dermatology included. A number of studies have shown that particle-based formulations can improve the skin penetration of topically applied drugs. However, for a successful translation of these promising results into a clinical application, a more rational approach is needed to take into account the different properties of diseased skin and the fate of these polymeric materials after topical application. In fact, each pathological skin condition poses different challenges and the way diseased skin interacts with polymeric carriers might be markedly different to that of healthy skin. In most inflammatory skin conditions, the skin's barrier is impaired and the local immune system is activated. A better understanding of such mechanisms has the potential to improve the efficacy of carrier-based dermatotherapy. Such knowledge would allow the informed choice of the type of polymeric carrier depending on the skin condition to be treated, the type of drug to be loaded, and the desired release kinetics. Furthermore, a better control of polymer degradation and release properties in accordance with the skin environment would improve the safety and the selectivity of drug release. This review aims at summarizing the current knowledge on how polymeric delivery systems interact with healthy and diseased skin, giving an overview of the challenges that different pathological skin conditions pose to the development of safer and more specific dermatotherapies.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to ascertain whether silver nitrate (AgNO3) concentrations below those used in clinical practice inhibit bacterial growth, and in parallel study the cytotoxic effects on human fibroblasts. The cytoprotective effects of fetal calf serum (FCS) were also evaluated. The cytotoxic effects of eight different silver nitrate concentrations were determined by assessing mitochondrial activity of viable cells capable of cleaving tetrazolium salts. Antimicrobial activity of AgNO3, range: 7-550 x 10(-5)\%, was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Silver nitrate concentrations exerting antimicrobial effects were: S. aureus, {\textgreater}70 x 10(-5)\%; P. aeruginosa, {\textgreater}/=270 x 10(-5)\%, and C. freundii, {\textgreater}/=550 x 10(-5)\%. With 2\% FCS, the lowest AgNO3 concentration studied (7 x 10(-5)\%) showed cytotoxic effects (cell survival 71 +/- 19\%) at only 2 h of incubation. Under these conditions AgNO3 cytotoxicity was time- and concentration-dependent in all exposure periods. Cytotoxicity was greatly enhanced causing 76\% fibroblast growth inhibition at concentrations of 14 x 10(-5)\% and contact time of 2 h. The AgNO3 concentration of 7 x 10(-5)\% was also cytotoxic with 5\% FCS in the media compared with controls, although cell survival was higher than with 2\% FCS. The cytoprotective action of FCS was clearly shown at the concentration of 10\% at which AgNO3 cytotoxicity of 7 x 10(-5)\% to 28 x 10(-5)\% was partially or completely inhibited. Our results show that AgNO3 at concentrations 100-700 times more diluted than that normally used in clinical practice retained effective inhibitory activity against some of the above-mentioned microorganisms. However, even these concentrations are cytotoxic for cultured fibroblasts. Thus, silver nitrate concentrations up to 100 times more diluted can be used, since they possess bacterial growth-inhibiting power, are less cytotoxic and therefore favour wound healing.},

Stable Ag nanoparticles were prepared and their shape and size distribution characterized by particle characterizer and transmission electron microscopic study. The antimicrobial activity of Ag nanoparticles was investigated against yeast, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. In these tests, Muller Hinton agar plates were used and Ag nanoparticles of various concentrations were supplemented in liquid systems. As results, yeast and E. coli were inhibited at the low concentration of Ag nanoparticles, whereas the growth-inhibitory effects on S. aureus were mild. The free-radical generation effect of Ag nanoparticles on microbial growth inhibition was investigated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. These results suggest that Ag nanoparticles can be used as effective growth inhibitors in various microorganisms, making them applicable to diverse medical devices and antimicrobial control systems.},

	abstract = {Background: The Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study (TIDOS) cohort follows military personnel with deployment-related injuries in order to evaluate short- and long-term infectious complications. High rates of infectious complications have been observed in more than 30\% of injured patients during initial hospitalization. We present data on infectious complications related to combat trauma after the initial period of hospitalization. Patients and Methods: Data related to patient care for military personnel injured during combat operations between June 2009 and May 2012 were collected. Follow-up data were captured from interviews with enrolled participants and review of electronic medical records.
Results: Among 1,006 patients enrolled in the TIDOS cohort with follow-up data, 357 (35\%) were diagnosed with one or more infection during their initial hospitalization, of whom 160 (45\%) developed a trauma-related infection during follow-up (4.2 infections per 10,000 person-days). Patients with three or more infections during the initial hospitalization had a signiﬁcantly higher rate of infections during the follow-up period compared with those with only one inpatient infection (incidence rate: 6.6 versus 3.1 per 10,000 days; p {\textless} 0.0001). There were 657 enrollees who did not have an infection during initial hospitalization, of whom 158 (24\%) developed one during follow-up (incidence rate: 1.6 per 10,000 days). Overall, 318 (32\%) enrolled patients developed an infection after hospital discharge (562 unique infections) with skin and soft-tissue infections being predominant (66\%) followed by osteomyelitis (16\%). Sustaining an amputation or open fracture, having an inpatient infection, and use of anti-pseudomonal penicillin (‡7 d) were independently associated with risk of an extremity wound infection during follow-up, whereas shorter hospitalization (15–30 d) was associated with a reduced risk.
Conclusions: Combat-injured patients have a high burden of infectious complications that continue long after the initial period of hospitalization with soft-tissue and osteomyelitis being predominant. Further research on the long-term impact and outcomes of combat-associated infection is needed.},

	abstract = {Wound matrix materials are used to improve the regeneration of dermal and epidermal layers in both acute and chronic wounds. Contemporary wound matrices are primarily composed of biologic materials such as processed xenogeneic and allogeneic tissues. Unfortunately, existing biologic wound matrices possess multiple limitations including poor longevity, durability, strength, and enzymatic resistance required for persistent support for new tissue formation. A fully-synthetic, resorbable electrospun material (Restrata Wound Matrix, Acera, St.Louis, Missouri ) that exhibits structural similarities to the native extracellular matrix offers a new approach to the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. This novel matrix is the first product to combine the advantages of synthetic construction (e.g. resistance to enzymatic degradation, excellent biocompatibility, strength/durability and controlled degradation) with the positive attributes of biologic materials (e.g. biomimetic architecture similar to human extracellular matrix (ECM), fibrous architecture optimized to support cellular migration and proliferation, engineered porosity to encourage tissue ingrowth and vascularization). These features allow RWM to achieve rapid and complete healing of full-thickness wounds that, in preclinical studies, is comparable to Integra Bilayer Wound Matrix (Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, New Jersey), a gold standard biologic material with diverse clinical indications in the wound care. Together, this review suggests that the RWM offers a unique fully-synthetic alternative to existing biologic matrices that is effective, widely available, easy to store, simple to apply and low cost.},

Herein, we demonstrated a simple and effective technique to construct electrospun 3D ﬁbrous scaffolds for accelerated wound healing using a photocrosslinkable hydrogel based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). We found that the physical properties of the photocrosslinkable hydrogel including water retention, stiffness, strength, elasticity and degradation can be tailored by changing the light exposure time. We further observed that the optimized hydrogel ﬁbrous scaffolds which were soft and elastic could support cell adhesion, proliferation and migration into the whole scaffolds, facilitating regeneration and formation of cutaneous tissues within two weeks. Such tunable characteristics of the ﬁbrous GelMA scaffolds distinguished them from other reported substrates developed for reconstruction of wound defects including glutaraldehyde-crosslinked gelatin or poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), whose physical and chemical properties were difﬁcult to modify to allow cell inﬁltration into the 3D scaffolds for tissue regeneration. We anticipate that the ability to become fully cellularized will make the engineered GelMA ﬁbrous scaffolds suitable for widespread applications as skin substitutes or wound dressings.},

Last decade of research in clinical science has seen materials at microscale developments which significantly contributed to ulcer management and wound healing with their merits and limitations. The present review outlines the new materials at nanoscale that have been designed and manufactured to address the existing problems in wound care but comparatively less familiar to clinicians for tissue repair and ulcer management. Development in tissue engineering practices spanning from micro- to nano- dimension provided superior materials over traditional wound dressing materials mimicking tissue in vivo. Recent advances in material sciences and polymer chemistry have yielded an entire class of new nanomaterials, ranging from bioactive tissue scaffold to novel electrospun polymer and hydrogel for tissue repair and wound management. Nanoscale materials with biodegradable chemistries and molecular compositions assist wound healing as adhesive and bandages in specialized wound care. Moreover, new class of materials gives opportunity to engineer tissue substrate in vitro to support bio-responsive nanomedicine for wound healing. Soft nanomaterial design technology involving hydrogel and bio-scaffold revolutionized the wound management supplementing biophysical and biochemical considerations of tissue regeneration. In addition, this review addresses the immediate challenges and opportunities provided by nanoscale tissue engineering in designing synthetic biomaterials as instructive extracellular matrix (ECM) for tissue remodeling and morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Objective: A prospective, randomized, two center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the impact on wound healing of Suprathel1 in donor sites of split-thickness skin grafts. Suprathel1 represents an absorbable, synthetic wound dressing with properties of natural epithelium.
Methods: 22 burn patients who were treated with split-thickness skin grafts, and with a mean age of 39.6 years were included in the study. Donor sites of skin grafts were randomly selected; partly treated with Jelonet1 and partly treated with Suprathel1. First gauze change was carried out the ﬁfth day postoperatively followed by regular wound inspection until complete re-epithelization. The study focused on patient pain score, healing time, analysis of wound bed, ease of care, and treatment costs.
Results: There was no signiﬁcant difference between the two materials tested regarding healing time and re-epithelization. There was a signiﬁcantly lower pain score for patients treated with Suprathel1 ( p = 0.0002). Suprathel1 became transparent when applied and allowed close monitoring of wound healing. In contrast to Jelonet1, Suprathel1 showed excellent plasticity with better attachment and adherence to wound surfaces. Throughout the healing process it detached from wounds without damaging the new epithelial surface. In addition, wound areas treated with Suprathel1 required less frequent dressing changes. It also demonstrated excellent ease of care. This, altogether with the signiﬁcant pain reduction, presented a positive feedback by patients and healthcare professionals who both rated Suprathel1 as their treatment preference. Though Jelonet1 is more cost effective as dressing material, the study revealed an overall reduction in total treatment costs achieved with Suprathel1.
Conclusion: Suprathel1 represents a solid, reliable epidermal skin substitute with impact on wound healing, patient comfort and ease of care. The material effectiveness contributes to the reduction of overall treatment costs.},

Current second-degree burn wound dressings absorb wound exudate, reduce bacterial infections, and maintain a moist environment for healing, but are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound, causing additional trauma to the newly formed tissues. We have developed an ondemand dissolvable dendritic thioester hydrogel burn dressing for second-degree burn care. The hydrogel is composed of a lysine-based dendron and a PEG-based crosslinker, which are synthesized in high yields. The hydrogel burn dressing covers the wound and acts as a barrier to bacterial infection in an in vivo second-degree burn wound model. A unique feature of the hydrogel is its capability to be dissolved on-demand, via a thiol–thioester exchange reaction, allowing for a facile burn dressing removal.},

Along with improved survival, new challenges have emerged in the management of burn patients. Infections top the list of the most common complication after burns, and sepsis is the leading cause of death in both adult and pediatric burn patients. The diagnosis and management of sepsis in burns is complex as a tremendous hypermetabolic response secondary to burn injury can be superimposed on systemic infection, leading to organ dysfunction. The management of a septic burn patient represents a challenging scenario that is commonly encountered by providers caring for burn patients despite preventive efforts. Here, we discuss the current perspectives in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock in burn patients.},

	abstract = {Noninfectious uveitis is a potentially blinding ocular condition that often requires treatment with corticosteroids to prevent inflammation-related ocular complications. Severe forms of uveitis such as panuveitis that affects the whole eye often require a combination of topical and either regional or systemic corticosteroid. Regional corticosteroids are currently delivered inside the eye by intravitreal injection (e.g. Ozurdex®, an intravitreal dexamethasone implant). Intravitreal injection is associated with rare but potentially serious side effects, including endophthalmitis, retinal and vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Subconjunctival (SCT) injection is a less invasive option that is a common route used for post-surgical drug administration and treatment of infection and severe inflammation. However, it is the water soluble form of dexamethasone, dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP), that has been demonstrated to achieve high intraocular penetration with subconjunctival injection. It is difficult to load highly water soluble drugs, such as DSP, and achieve sustained drug release using conventional encapsulation methods. We found that use of carboxyl-terminated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) allowed encapsulation of DSP into biodegradable nanoparticles (NP) with relatively high drug content (6\% w/w) if divalent zinc ions were used as an ionic “bridge” between the PLGA and DSP. DSP-Zn-NP had an average diameter of 210 nm, narrow particle size distribution (polydispersity index {\textasciitilde}0.1), and near neutral surface charge (−9 mV). DSP-Zn-NP administered by SCT injection provided detectable DSP levels in both the anterior chamber and vitreous chamber of the eye for at least 3 weeks. In a rat model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), inflammation was significantly reduced in both the front and back of the eye in animals that received a single SCT injection of DSP-Zn-NP as compared to animals that received either aqueous DSP solution or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). DSP-Zn-NP efficacy was evidenced by a reduced clinical disease score, decreased expression of various inflammatory cytokines, and preserved retinal structure and function. Furthermore, SCT DSP-Zn-NP significantly reduced microglia cell density in the retina, a hallmark of EAU in rats. DSP-Zn-NP hold promise as a new strategy to treat noninfectious uveitis and potentially other ocular inflammatory disorders.},

Topical corticosteroids are the first line treatment for suppressing CNV, but poor ocular bioavailability and rapid clearance of eye drops makes frequent administration necessary. Patient compliance with frequent eye drop application regimens is poor. We developed biodegradable nanoparticles (NP) loaded with dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) using zinc ion bridging, DSP-Zn-NP, with dense coatings of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). DSP-Zn-NP were safe and capable of providing sustained delivery of DSP to the front of the eye following subconjunctival (SCT) administration in rats. We reported that a single SCT administration of DSP-Zn-NP prevented sutureinduced CNV in rats for two weeks. In contrast, the eyes receiving SCT administration of either saline or DSP solution developed extensive CNV in less than 1 week. SCT administration of DSP-Zn-NP could be an effective strategy in preventing and treating CNV.},

Vaginal progesterone supplementation has been demonstrated to reduce PTB rates in women with a sonographic short cervix, yet there has been little investigation into the most eﬀective dose or delivery form. Further, vaginal products like progesterone gel often contain excipients that cause local toxicity, irritation, and leakage. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a mucoinert vaginal progesterone nanosuspension formulation for improved drug delivery to the female reproductive tract. We compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to the clinical comparator progesterone gel in pregnant mice and demonstrate increased vaginal absorption and biodistribution via the uterine ﬁrst-pass eﬀect. Importantly, the unique plasma progesterone double peak observed in humans, reﬂecting recirculation from the uterus, was also observed in pregnant mice with vaginal dosing. We adapted a mouse model of progesterone withdrawal that was previously believed to be incompatible with testing the eﬃcacy of exogenous progestins, and are ﬁrst to demonstrate eﬃcacy in preventing preterm birth with vaginal progesterone in this model. Further, improved vaginal progesterone delivery by the nanosuspension led to increased eﬃcacy in PTB prevention. Additionally, we identiﬁed histological and transcriptional evidence of cervical and uterine toxicity with a single vaginal administration of the clinical gel that are absent after dosing with the mucoinert nanosuspension formulation. We demonstrate that a progesterone formulation that is designed for improved vaginal progesterone absorption and vaginal biocompatibility could be more eﬀective for PTB prevention.},

	abstract = {Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inﬂammatory gastrointestinal disorder that aﬀects more than 1 million individuals in the USA. Local therapy with enema formulations, such as micronized budesonide (Entocort®), is a common strategy for treating patients with distally active IBD. However, we hypothesize that micronized particulates are too large to eﬀectively penetrate colorectal mucus, limiting the extent of drug delivery to aﬀected tissues prior to clearance. Here, we describe the development of a budesonide nanosuspension (NS) with the appropriate surface coating and size to enhance penetration of colorectal mucus and ulcerated colorectal tissues. We demonstrate that model ﬂuorescent polystyrene (PS) particles ∼200 nm in size with a muco-inert Pluronic F127 coating provide enhanced mucosal distribution and tissue penetration in mice with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD compared to model 2 μm PS particles coated with polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP), the stabilizer used in the clinical micronized budesonide formulation. We then used a wet-milling process to develop a budesonide NS formulation with a muco-inert Pluronic F127 coating (particle size ∼230 nm), as well as a budesonide microsuspension (MS) stabilized with PVP (particle size ∼2 μm). Using an acute TNBS mouse model of IBD, we show that daily budesonide NS enema treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the macroscopic (decreased colon weight) and microscopic (histology score) symptoms of IBD compared to untreated controls or mice treated daily with the budesonide MS enema. Further, we show that the budesonide NS enema treated mice had a signiﬁcantly reduced number of inﬂammatory macrophages and IL-β producing CD11b + cells in colon tissue compared to untreated controls or mice treated with the budesonide MS enema. We conclude that the nano-size and muco-inert coating allowed for enhanced local delivery of budesonide, and thus, a more signiﬁcant impact on local colorectal tissue inﬂammation.},

	abstract = {Without a scale-down model for perfusion, high resource demand makes cell line screening or process development challenging; therefore potentially successful cell lines or perfusion processes are unrealised and their ability untapped. We present here the re-functioning of a high capacity microscale system that is typically employed in fed-batch process development to allow perfusion operation utilising in situ gravity settling and automated sampling. In this low resource setting, which involved routine perturbations in mixing, pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations, the specific productivity and the maximum cell concentration were higher than 3.0x106 mg/cell/day and 7x107 cells/ml, respectively, across replicate microscale perfusion runs conducted at one vessel volume exchange per day. A comparative analysis was conducted at bench scale with vessels operated in perfusion mode utilising a cell retention device. Neither specific productivity nor product quality indicated by product aggregation [6\%] was significantly different across scales 19 days post inoculation, thus demonstrating this setup to be a suitable and reliable platform for evaluating the performance of cell lines and the effect of process parameters relevant to perfusion mode of culturing.},

	abstract = {Closure of ocular wounds after an accident or surgery is typically performed by suturing, which is associated with numerous potential complications, including suture breakage, inﬂammation, secondary neovascularization, erosion to the surface and secondary infection, and astigmatism; for example, more than half of post-corneal transplant infections are due to suture related complications. Tissue adhesives provide promising substitutes for sutures in ophthalmic surgery. Ocular adhesives are not only intended to address the shortcomings of sutures, but also designed to be easy to use, and can potentially minimize post-operative complications. Herein, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and application of ocular adhesives, along with their advantages, limitations, and potential are discussed. This review covers two main classes of ocular adhesives: (1) synthetic adhesives based on cyanoacrylates, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and other synthetic polymers, and (2) adhesives based on naturally derived polymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides. In addition, diﬀerent technologies to cover and protect ocular wounds such as contact bandage lenses, contact lenses coupled with novel technologies, and decellularized corneas are discussed. Continued advances in this area can help improve both patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to design a new family of biodegradable synthetic polymeric biomaterials for providing a tunable inhibition of macrophage’s nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. L-Arginine (Arg) is the common substrate for NOS and arginase. Both two metabolic pathways participate in the wound healing process. An impaired wound healing, such as diabetic or other chronic wounds is usually associated with an overproduction of NO by macrophages via the NOS pathway. In this study, a new family of L-nitroarginine (NOArg) based polyester amide (NOArg-PEA) and NOArg-Arg PEA copolymers (coPEA) were designed and synthesized with different composition ratios. The NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs are biodegradable (more than 50\% degradation in vitro in 4 days at 37 °C), biocompatible and did not activate the resting macrophage immune response per se. When classically activated or alternatively activated macrophages (CAM/AAM) were incubated with NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs, the treatments decreased the NO production of CAM, increased the arginase activity in both CAM and AAM, increased TGF-b1 production of CAM to various degrees and had no signiﬁcant effect on TNF-a production. Diabetic rat models were used to evaluate the efﬁcacy of NOArg-PEA and NOArg-Arg co-PEAs on wound healing. Diabetic rats treated with 2-NOArg-4 PEA, 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 20/80, and 2-NOArg-4Arg-4 50/50 biomaterials achieved 40\%–80\% faster-wound healing when compared with the control on day 7. The data from the histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the 2-NOArg-4Arg-4 20/80 and 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 50/50 treatments led to more AAM phenotypes (CD206) and arginase I production in wound tissue than the control during the ﬁrst 7 days, i.e., suggesting pro-healing wound microenvironment with improved re-epithelialization of wound healing. A similar trend was retained until day 14. The 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 20/80 and 2-NOArg-4-Arg-4 50/50 treatments also increased the collagen deposition and angiogenesis in the healing wound between day 7 and day 14. Both in vitro and in vivo data of this study showed that this new family of NOArg-Arg co-PEA biomaterials have the potential as viable alternatives for treating impaired wound healing, such as diabetic or other types of chronic wounds.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GB) is a highly inﬁltrative tumor, recurring, in 90\% of cases, within a few centimeters of the surgical resection cavity, even with adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Residual GB cells left in the margins or inﬁltrating the brain parenchyma shelter behind the extremely fragile and sensitive brain tissue and may favor recurrence. Tools for eliminating these cells without damaging the brain microenvironment are urgently required. We propose a strategy involving the implantation, into the tumor bed after resection, of a scaffold to concentrate and trap these cells, to facilitate their destruction by targeted therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery. We used bacterial cellulose (BC), an easily synthesized and modiﬁable random nanoﬁbrous biomaterial, to make the trap. We showed that the structure of BC membranes was ideal for trapping tumor cells and that BC implants were biocompatible with brain parenchyma. We also demonstrated the visibility of BC on magnetic resonance imaging, making it possible to follow its fate in clinical situations and to deﬁne the target volume for stereotactic radiosurgery more precisely. Furthermore, BC membranes can be loaded with chemoattractants, which were released and attracted tumor cells in vitro. This is of particular interest for trapping GB cells inﬁltrating tissues within a few centimeters of the resection cavity. Our data suggest that BC membranes could be a scaffold of choice for implantation after surgical resection to trap residual GB cells.},

	abstract = {Halomonas has been developed as a platform for the next generation industrial biotechnology (NGIB) allowing open and non-sterile growth without microbial contamination under a high salt concentration and alkali pH. To reduce downstream cost associated with continuous centrifugation and salt containing wastewater treatment, Halomonas campaniensis strain LS21 was engineered to become self-flocculating by knocking out an etf operon encoding two subunits of an electron transferring flavoprotein in the predicted electron transfer chain. Self-flocculation could be attributed to the decrease of the surface charge and increase of the cellular hydrophobicity resulted from deleted etf. A wastewaterless fermentation strategy based on the self-flocculating H. campaniensis was developed for growth and the production of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) as an example. Most microbial cells flocculated and precipitated to the bottom of the bioreactor within 1 minute after stopping the aeration and agitation. The supernatant can be used again without sterilization or inoculation for the growth of the next batch after collecting the precipitated cell mass. The wastewaterless process was conducted for four runs without generating wastewater. PHB accumulation by the self-flocculent strain was enhanced via promoter and RBS optimizations, the productivities of cell dry weight (CDW) and PHB were increased from 0.45 g/L/h and 0.18 g/L/h for the batch process compared to 0.82 g/L/h and 0.33 g/L/h for the wastewaterless continuous process, respectively. This has clearly demonstrated the advantages of the wastewaterless process in that it not only reduces wastewater but also increases cell growth and product formation efficiency in a given period of time.},

The synthesized hydrogels exhibit good adhesion not only on various organic and inorganic surfaces (such as polythene, polytetraﬂuoroethylene, rubber, ceramics, glass, and copper) but also on many biological tissue surfaces (e.g., heart, liver, lung, kidney, and hogskin). Compared with hydrogels only containing catechol moieties, the adhesion strength of microgelcontaining hydrogels increased 8 times on glass substrates. In addition, the adhesive hydrogel also exhibits rapid self-healing and good stretchability due to the noncovalent interaction between the microgel and the hydrogel matrix. On the whole, doping microgel in the construction of multifunctional hydrogels substantially improved their adhesive ability on many types of surfaces.},

Hydrazone-based gelators decorated with non-ionic and anionic groups are formed in situ from hydrazide and aldehyde building blocks, and lead through multiple self-sorting processes to the formation of heterogeneous gels approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Interestingly, the addition of seeds composing of oligomers of gelators bypasses the self-sorting processes and accelerates the selfassembly along a kinetically favored pathway, resulting in homogeneous gels of which the network morphologies and gel stiffness are markedly different from the thermodynamically more stable gel products. Importantly, over time, these metastable homogeneous gel networks are capable of converting into the thermodynamically more stable state. This seeding-driven formation of out-of-equilibrium supramolecular structures is expected to serve as a simple approach towards functional materials with pathwaydependent properties.},

The conﬁrmation of the CS-MA chemical structure was carried out by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FTIR and the degree of MA substituent on CS was calculated from the ratios of two peak intensities corresponding to methyl groups on methacrylate and chondroitin sulfate, respectively. Hydrogels were prepared by free radical polymerization of CS-MA precursors with or without acrylic acid (AA). CS-MA hydrogels were easily broken into small pieces during swelling study. However, CS-MA-AA hydrogels remained completely and showed a range of swelling ratio from 200 to 390\% and exhibited an increase in swelling ratio with a decreasing degree of MA substitution. The thermal degradability observed with a TGA explained the unstableness of these hydrogels in comparison with the pure CS. The surface morphology conducted by SEM exhibited a porous structure after swelling.},

The physico-chemical properties of glycol chitins with different degrees of acetylation (DA) were investigated in terms of degradation, cytotoxicity, rheological properties, and in vitro and in vivo gel formation. Aqueous solutions of glycol chitins were ﬂowable freely at room temperature but quickly became a durable gel at body temperature. Thermoreversible sol–gel transition properties were observed with fast gelation kinetics. Glycol chitins with higher DA showed faster degradation in the presence of lysozyme. They exhibited no signiﬁcant biological toxicity against human cell lines. An anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin, could be incorporated into the hydrogel by a simple mixing process and released in a sustained pattern over 13 days. Our ﬁndings suggest that glycol chitins could be useful as a new thermogelling biomaterial for drug delivery and injectable tissue engineering.},

The carboxyl groups on chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains were functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to yield chondroitin sulfate succinimidyl succinate (CS–NHS). Following puriﬁcation, the CS–NHS molecule can react with primary amines to form amide bonds. Hence, using six arm polyethylene glycol amine PEG–(NH2)6 as a crosslinker we formed a hydrogel which was covalently bound to proteins in tissue via amide bonds. By varying the initial pH of the precursor solutions, the hydrogel stiffness, swelling properties, and kinetics of gelation could be controlled. The sealing/adhesive strength could also be modiﬁed by varying the damping and storage modulus properties of the material. The adhesive strength of the material with cartilage tissue was shown to be ten times higher than that of ﬁbrin glue. Cells encapsulated or in direct contact with the material remained viable and metabolically active. Furthermore, CS–PEG material produced minimal inﬂammatory response when implanted subcutaneously in a rat model and enzymatic degradation was demonstrated in vitro. This work establishes an adhesive hydrogel derived from biological and synthetic components with potential application in wound healing and regenerative medicine.},

Crosslinked hydrogels comprising aminated star polyethylene glycol and high molecular weight dextran aldehyde polymers (PEG:dextran) display aldehyde-mediated adhesion and readily tunable reactivity with soft tissue ex-vivo. Evaluation of PEG:dextran compositional variants revealed that the burst pressure of repaired intestinal wounds and the extent of material-induced tissue deformation both increase nonlinearly with formulation aldehyde content and are consistently within the desired range established by traditional sealants. Adhesive test elements featuring PEG:dextran and intestinal tissue exhibited considerable viscoelasticity, prompting use of a standard linear solid (SLS) model to describe adhesive mechanics. Model elements were accurately represented as continuous functions of PEG:dextran chemistry, facilitating prediction of adhesive mechanics across the examined range of compositional formulations. SLS models of traditional sealants were also constructed to allow general correlative analyses between viscoelastic adhesive mechanics and metrics of sealant performance. Linear correlation of equilibrium SLS stiffness to sealant-induced tissue deformation indicates that dense adhesive crosslinking restricts tissue expansion, while correlation of instantaneous SLS stiffness to burst pressure suggests that the adhesive stress relaxation capacity of PEG:dextran enhances their overall performance relative to traditional sealants.},

	abstract = {Soft tissue adhesives are employed to repair and seal many different organs, which range in both tissue surface chemistry and mechanical challenges during organ function. This complexity motivates the development of tunable adhesive materials with high resistance to uniaxial or multiaxial loads dictated by a speciﬁc organ environment. Co-polymeric hydrogels comprising aminated star polyethylene glycol and dextran aldehyde (PEG:dextran) are materials exhibiting physico-chemical properties that can be modiﬁed to achieve this organ- and tissue-speciﬁc adhesion performance. Here we report that resistance to failure under speciﬁc loading conditions, as well as tissue response at the adhesive material–tissue interface, can be modulated through regulation of the number and density of adhesive aldehyde groups. We ﬁnd that atomic force microscopy (AFM) can characterize the material aldehyde density available for tissue interaction, and in this way enable rapid, informed material choice. Further, the correlation between AFM quantiﬁcation of nanoscale unbinding forces with macroscale measurements of adhesion strength by uniaxial tension or multiaxial burst pressure allows the design of materials with speciﬁc cohesion and adhesion strengths. However, failure strength alone does not predict optimal in vivo reactivity. Thus, we demonstrate that the development of adhesive materials is signiﬁcantly enabled when experiments are integrated along length scales to consider organ chemistry and mechanical loading states concurrently with adhesive material properties and tissue response.},

Only a few commercially tissue sealants are available to be used for internal tissue or organ hemorrhage control. This study introduced two in situ injectable hydrogels for hemorrhage control: self-crosslinking gelatin (sc-G) hydrogel and hyaluronic acid/gelatin (HA/G) hydrogel. They were prepared on the tissue surface in situ and characterized by rheological analysis, stability, cytotoxicity, and bursting strength test. The hemostatic ability of the hydrogels was evaluated in a liver-bleeding rat model. The sc-G and HA/G hydrogels gelled around 90 s and 50 s, respectively. They were preferable for cell attachment and proliferation. The bursting strengths of both hydrogels exceeded that of fibrin glue. The hemostatic ability of HA/G hydrogel was better than that of sc-G hydrogel, and was same as that of fibrin glue. The HA/G hydrogel could be used as a tissue sealant for hemorrhage control in clinic.},

	abstract = {The plastic behaviour by crazing of a series of polystyrene/polybutadienediblock copolymers with a morphology of randomly dispersed PB spheres has been investigated at both +20 and -20°C. Materials with volume fractions of PB exceeding 011 were found to be quite tough in tension, with typical craze flow stresses of around 30 MPa and strains to fracture of around 04. Growth rates of individual crazes were studied in detail in all blends. Electron microscopy established that in the material exhibiting good toughness, crazes grew by cavitation of the spherical PB domains, followed by plastic drawing of the remaining PS carcass. The growth rates of such crazes could be modelled quite well by the advance of a cavitation front in a planar layer of a thickness equal to the PB domain diameter.When volume fractionsof PB were much lower than 0.1,the craze growth rates became quite low and exhibited kinetics that fitted the interface convolution mechanism of craze growth. The good agreement between the kinetics of craze grow.tb and uniaxial tensile craze plasticity points to the importance of craze growth kinetics in the overall kinetics of craze plasticity and in obtaining toughness.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Severe burns are often associated with high morbidity and unsatisfactory functional and esthetic outcomes. Over the last two decades, stem cells have generated great hopes for the treatment of numerous conditions including burns. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the role of stem cell therapy as a means to promote burn wound healing.
Methods: Comprehensive searches in major databases were carried out in March 2017 for articles on stem cell therapy in burn wound healing. In total 2103 articles were identified and screened on the basis of pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results: Fifteen experimental and two clinical studies were included in the review. The majority of studies reported significant improvement in macroscopic burn wound appearance as well as a trend toward improved microscopic appearance, after stem cell therapy. Other parameters evaluated, such as re-vascularization, collagen formation, level of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, apoptosis and cellular infiltrates, yielded heterogeneous results across studies.
Conclusion: Stem cell therapy appears to exert a positive effect in burn wound healing. There is, therefore, justification for continued efforts to evaluate the use of stem cells as an adjunct to first-line therapies in burns.},

	abstract = {Seeking strategies to enhance the overall combinations of mechanical properties is of great signiﬁcance for engineering materials, but still remains a key challenge because many of these properties are often mutually exclusive. Here we reveal from the perspective of materials science and mechanics that adaptive structural reorientation during deformation, which is an operating mechanism in a wide variety of composite biological materials, functions more than being a form of passive response to allow for ﬂexibility, but offers an effective means to simultaneously enhance rigidity, robustness, mechanical stability and damage tolerance. As such, the conﬂicts between different mechanical properties can be ‘‘defeated” in these composites merely by adjusting their structural orientation. The constitutive relationships are established based on the theoretical analysis to clarify the effects of structural orientation and reorientation on mechanical properties, with some of the ﬁndings validated and visualized by computational simulations. Our study is intended to give insight into the ingenious designs in natural materials that underlie their exceptional mechanical efﬁciency, which may provide inspiration for the development of new man-made materials with enhanced mechanical performance.},

Our thermal melting, dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computational analysis indicate that hyaluronic acid (HA), an ECM component, can stabilize siRNA by hydrogen bonds as well as by Van der Waals interactions. Such stabilization facilitated HA size and concentration-dependent gene silencing in CD44 positive human osteosarcoma cell line (MG63) as well as human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) but not so efficiently in low-CD44 expressing human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The cell surface CD44 mediated siRNA uptake was validated by receptor blocking experiments.

	abstract = {Messenger RNA-based vaccines have the potential to trigger robust cytotoxic immune responses, which are essential for ﬁghting cancer and infectious diseases like HIV. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are choice targets for mRNAbased vaccine strategies, as they link innate and adaptive immune responses and are major regulators of cytotoxic and humoral adaptive responses. However, eﬃcient delivery of antigen-coding mRNAs into DC cytosol has been highly challenging. In this study, we developed an alternative to lipid-based mRNA delivery systems, using poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles (PLA-NPs) and cationic cell-penetrating peptides as mRNA condensing agent. The formulations are assembled in two steps: (1) formation of a polyplex between mRNAs and amphipathic cationic peptides (RALA, LAH4 or LAH4-L1), and (2) adsorption of polyplexes onto PLA-NPs. LAH4-L1/mRNA polyplexes and PLA-NP/LAH4-L1/mRNA nanocomplexes are taken up by DCs via phagocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and induce strong protein expression in DCs in vitro. They modulate DC innate immune response by activating both endosome and cytosolic Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), and induce markers of adaptive responses in primary human DCs in vitro, with prevalent Th1 signature. Thus, LAH4-L1/mRNA and PLA-NP/ LAH4-L1/mRNA represent a promising platform for ex vivo treatment and mRNA vaccine development.},

An unexpected connection was made between adhesion and Maillard chemistry, known to be at the heart of cooking foods.

Second, subcutaneous implantation of tubular scaffolds coated with recombinant Olfml3 resulted in enhanced cell in-growth and neovascularization compared with control scaffolds.

The formation of stable polyelectrolyte complexes between poly-L-lysine (PLL) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with different sulfation degree – heparin (HEP), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) – is optimized by zeta-potential titrations. These PLL/GAG complexes are transformed into compact polyelectrolyte complexes (coPECs) with controlled water contents and densities via baroplastic processing. Rotational shear tests demonstrate that coPECs containing sulfated GAGs (HEP or CS) have solid-like properties, whereas HA-based complexes form highly hydrated viscous-like networks. The adhesiveness of the generated coPECs (normalized lap shear strength) is tested in dry and wet states using polystyrene and rabbit skin, respectively. In dry state, the adhesives exhibit lap shear strengths in the order of hundreds of kPa, with coPLL/HEP and coPLL/CS being about 1.5 times stronger than coPLL/HA. In wet state, all coPECs seal rabbit skin and recover over 60\% of the elongation capacity of intact skin with coPLL/HA providing the sturdiest adhesion (\$85\% elongation recovery). We demonstrate that this is due to the higher water fraction that improves the bonding between the wet specimens, showcasing the potential superior mechanical recovery on injured tissues.},

	abstract = {There is tremendous scientiﬁc interest in developing biodegradable ﬁlms through facile and versatile strategies. Although extensive studies on the preparation of chitosan ﬁlms have been conducted, the reported results commonly present low mechanical strength and weak water resistance. In the present study, high strength and signiﬁcantly water resistance single-cross-linked chitosan-oxidized tannic acid (SC-CS/OTA) composite ﬁlms and double cross-linked chitosan/ oxidized tannic acid/FeIII (DC-CS/OTA/FeIII) composite ﬁlms were created through a Schiﬀ base reaction and metal coordination. As a result, the optimal tensile strength of SC-CS/OTA composite ﬁlms and DC-CS/OTA/FeIII composite ﬁlms was 35.92 and 209 MPa, respectively. Notably, when compared with other chitosan-based ﬁlms, the tensile strength of DC-CS/OTA/ FeIII composite ﬁlms was approximately three times stronger. Moreover, the water vapor permeability (WVP) values of the ﬁlms with FeIII(0.66 ± 0.03 × 10−10 g/m·h·Pa) was lower than that of ﬁlms without FeIII (1.33 ± 0.01 × 10−10 g/m·h·Pa). More importantly, WVP values of the DC-CS/OTA/FeIII composite ﬁlms were 3−4 orders of magnitude lower than those of chitosan ﬁlms previously reported. The SC-CS/OTA composite ﬁlms (96.69\%) and DC-CS/OTA/FeIII composite ﬁlms (99.06\%) also presented high DPPH radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, SC-CS/OTA and DC-CS/OTA/FeIII hydrogels were also prepared. This work can be widely applied in the food, biomedical science, and wastewater treatment ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {This study describes the ﬁrst use of laccase− lipase enzymatic reaction for the synthesis of novel perfectly structured alternating copolymers. Initially, six types of complexing agents, linear(A)−linear(B), linear(A)−linear(B)− linear(A), linear−dendritic, dendritic−linear−dendritic, linear−hyperbranched, and hyperbranched−linear−hyperbranched amphiphilic block copolymers, are proven to signiﬁcantly enhance enzyme activity of three diﬀerent types of lipases - Penicillium camemberti, Candida rugosa, and Burkholderia cepacia (up to 1400\%, 1700\%, and 870\% increase with respect to the native enzymes). The copolymerization is performed in several consecutive steps: (a) lipase and laccase are dissolved in aqueous medium at neutral pH; (b) a complexing agent is added leading to cocompartmentalization of the two enzymes within a micelle or physical network; (c) the two comonomers are introduced simultaneously to the tandem enzyme complex. The reaction proceeds in the following pathway: laccase catalyzes the oxidation of catechol to o-quinone followed by lipase comediated Michael addition of a diamine. While laccase could catalyze the entire process, addition of lipase is able to increase copolymer yield up to 30.7\%. Addition of a complexing agent improves the yield further up to 67.9\% (23.2\% yield obtained for native laccase). Complexing agents signiﬁcantly increase polymer molecular mass (Mw = 130 900 vs 35 500 Da for the native enzymes reaction system). The resulting copolymers are highly ﬂuorescent (quantum yield up to 0.733) and demonstrate pH sensitive behavior, properties that hint toward their potential as imaging agents.},

Herein, we examine the complexities of polyester degradation behavior, its assessment, and strategies for reﬁnement. The factors governing polyester degradation are strikingly complex. In addition to the half-life of the hydrolytically labile bond, a series of interdependent material properties must be considered. Thus, methods used to characterize such material properties, both before and during degradation, must be carefully selected. Assessment of degradation behavior is further complicated by the variability of reported test protocols and the need for accelerated rather than real-time in vitro testing conditions. Ultimately, through better control of degradation behavior and correlation of in vitro, simulated degradation to that observed in vivo, the development of superior devices prepared with polyester biomaterials may be achieved.},

However, suitable nanostructures capable of loading a range of drugs (including hydrophobic/hydrophilic small molecules or biomolecular agents) together with the codelivery of siRNAs that avoid the problem of cation-associated cytotoxicity, are lacking. Herein, we report a novel, siRNA-based vesicle (siRNAsome) nanostructure which consists of a hydrophilic siRNA shell, a thermal and intracellular reduction sensitive hydrophobic median layer, and an empty aqueous interior that meets this need. The siRNAsome can serve as a versatile nanostructure to load drug agents with divergent chemical properties, therapeutic proteins as well as codelivering immobilized siRNAs without transfection agents. Importantly, a particular advantage of our siRNAsome is that inherent thermal/reduction responsiveness enables it to control drug loading and release. We show that when siRNAsomes are loaded with the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox·HCl) and anti-P-glycoprotein (Pgp) siRNA (to target the Pgp drug exporter), synergistic therapeutic activity is achieved in multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cells and tumor model.},

	abstract = {Melt processing is routinely used to fabricate medical polymeric devices/implants for clinical reconstruction and can be incorporated into quality systems procedures for medical device manufacture. As additive manufacturing (AM) becomes increasingly used for biomaterials and biofabrication, the translation of new, customizable, medical devices to the clinic becomes paramount. Melt processing is therefore a distinguishable group within AM that provides an avenue to manufacture scaffolds/implants with a clinical end-point. Three key melt processing AM technologies are highlighted in this review: melt micro-extrusion, selective laser sintering and melt electrospinning writing. The in vivo (including clinical) outcomes of medical devices and scaffolds made with these processes are reviewed. Together, they encompass the melt AM of scaffold architectures with feature sizes and resolutions ranging from 800 nm up to 700 μm.},

	abstract = {While articular cartilage defects affect millions of people worldwide from adolescents to adults, the repair of articular cartilage defects still remains challenging due to the limited endogenous regeneration of the tissue and poor integration with implants. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed scaffold functionalized with aggrecan that supports the cellular fraction of bone marrow released from microfracture, a widely used clinical procedure, and demonstrated tremendous improvement of regenerated cartilage tissue quality and joint function in a lapine model. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed doubled thickness of the regenerated cartilage tissue in the group treated with our aggrecan functionalized scaffold compared to standard microfracture treatment. H\&E staining showed 366 ± 95 chondrocytes present in the unit area of cartilage layer with the support of bioactive scaffold, while conventional microfracture group showed only 112 ± 26 chondrocytes. The expression of type II collagen appeared almost 10 times higher with our approach compared to normal microfracture, indicating the potential to overcome the fibro-cartilage formation associated with the current microfracture approach. The therapeutic effect was also evaluated at joint function level. The mobility was evaluated using a modified Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. While the defect control group showed no movement improvement over the course of study, all experimental groups showed a trend of increasing scores over time. The present work developed an effective method to regenerate critical articular defects by combining a 3D-printed therapeutic scaffold with the microfracture surgical procedure. This biofunctionalized acellular scaffold has great potential to be applied as a supplement for traditional microfracture to improve the quality of cartilage regeneration in a cost and labor effective way.},

	abstract = {Porous scaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering because they can guide cells and tissues to grow, synthesize extracellular matrix and other biological molecules, and facilitate the formation of functional tissues and organs. Although various natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have been used to fabricate the scaffolds, synthetic polymers have been more widely used for scaffolds since they have good mechanical strength, reproducible/controllable mechanical-chemical properties, and controllable biodegradation rates. However, the ‘hydrophobic character’ of common synthetic polymers is considered a limitation for tissue engineering applications because it can lead to a low initial cell seeding density, heterogeneous cell distribution in the scaffold, and slow cell growth due to insufficient absorption/diffusion of cell culture medium into scaffold and lack of specific interaction sites with cells. The hydrophilization of porous synthetic polymer scaffolds has been considered as one of the simple but effective approaches to achieve desirable in vitro cell culture and in vivo tissue regeneration within the scaffolds. In this review paper, representative synthetic biodegradable polymers and techniques to fabricate porous scaffolds are briefly summarized and their hydrophilization techniques to improve cell/tissue compatibility are discussed.},

Specifically, PLA nanofibers have widened the possible uses of PLA scaffolds for regenerative medicine and drug delivery applications. The use of nanofibrous scaffolds imparts a host of desirable properties, including high surface area, biomimicry of native extracellular matrix architecture, and tuning of mechanical properties, all of which are important facets of designing scaffolds for a particular organ system. Additionally, nanofibrous PLA scaffolds hold great promise as drug delivery carriers, where fabrication parameters and drug-PLA compatibility greatly affect the drug release kinetics.

Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is considered one of the most thrivingly synthesized biodegradable polymers. To formulate polymeric nanostructures, PLGA has attained noteworthy attention due to its controllable properties, complete biodegradability and biocompatibility, well defined formulation techniques and easy processing. This review focuses on fabrication techniques of PLGA based nanostructures and their advanced biomedical applications covering drug delivery and in-vivo imaging. Researchers have extensively investigated the potential of PLGA nanoparticles for target specific and controlled delivery of various micro and macromolecules including drugs, peptides, proteins, monoclonal antibodies, growth factors and DNA in multifarious biomedical applications like neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory disorders, cancer and other dreadful health disorders. Beside this, PLGA is being employed for theranostic purposes where polymer is attached with contrast agents for imaging-directed chemo or photo thermal combinative therapy. Multifunctional PLGA nanostructures have given an avenue to future nanomedicine to consider simultaneous drug delivery, molecular imaging, and real-time monitoring of therapeutic response. This review describes the applications of PLGA in drug delivery revealing its current progress and direction for future research.},

Histological examination of all the implants with haematoxylin and eosin staining, masson trichrome staining, SM α-actin antibody, and CM-DiI labeling confirmed that the regular morphology and biofunction of the SMCs seeded and the expression of the vascular smooth muscle matrices in PLCL scaffolds. The implanted PLCL scaffolds displayed a slow degradation on time, where caprolactone units were faster degraded than lactide did. This could be explained by the fact that amorphous regions composed of mainly CL moieties degraded earlier than hard domains where most of the LA units were located. From these results, the scaffolds applied in this study were found to exhibit excellent tissue compatibility to SMCs and might be very useful for vascular tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {A soft and very elastic poly(lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL)(50:50, M n 185 × 103) was synthesized. Tubular scaffolds were prepared by an extrusion-particulate leaching method for mechano-active vascular tissue engineering. The copolymer was very flexible but completely rubber-like elastic. Even the high porous PLCL scaffolds (90\% salt wt) exhibited 200\% elongation, but recovery over 85\% in a tensile test. Moreover, the PLCL scaffolds maintained their high elasticity also in culture media under cyclic mechanical strain conditions. The highly porous scaffold (90\% salt wt) withstood for an initial 1 week without any deformation and sustained for 2 weeks in culture media under cyclic stress of 10\% amplitude and at 1 Hz frequency which are similar to the natural vascular conditions. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were seeded on to the PLCL scaffolds. The cell adhesion and proliferation on the scaffolds of various pore-size were increased with increasing pore size. For the pore sizes of 50-100 μm, 100-150 μm, 150-200 μm and 200-250 μm, the ratios of cell numbers were about 1:1.2:1.9:2.2, respectively, at both 12 h and 5 days. Similarly, the higher porous scaffolds exhibited more cell adhesion and proliferation compared to lower porous one, where the effect was more pronounced in the longer proliferation period. SMC-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice to confirm the biocompatibility. Such a high elastic property and proper biocompatibility to SMCs of PLCL scaffolds prepared in this study will be very useful to engineer SM-containing tissues such as blood vessels under mechanically dynamic environments (mechano-active tissue engineering).},

A strong, biodegradable, and biocompatible elastomer could be useful for fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and in vivo sensing. We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tough biodegradable elastomer from biocompatible monomers. This elastomer forms a covalently crosslinked, three-dimensional network of random coils with hydroxyl groups attached to its backbone. Both crosslinking and the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups likely contribute to the unique properties of the elastomer. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the polymer has good biocompatibility.

Biopolymers often have inferior properties compared to commodity polymers. Modification is a way to improve properties and achieve property combinations required for specific applications. One technique is blending which allows considerable improvement in the impact resistance of brittle polymers. However, further study is needed on the miscibility–structure–property relationships of these materials to utilize all potentials of the approach. The chemical structure of biopolymers opens up possibilities to their reactive modification. Copolymerization, grafting, trans-esterification, the use of reactive coupling agents have all been utilized with success to achieve polymers and blends with improved properties. Several examples are shown for the various approaches and their outcome.

Most of these models cater only to single step, diffusion-controlled release while a few attempt to describe bi-phasic release. All these models, however, are only applicable to drug release from single (unblended) degradable polymer systems. In this paper, we propose and test novel models for drug (notably paclitaxel) release from films made of neat poly (ε-caprolactone) PCL, neat poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) PLGA and their blends. The model developed for neat PCL consists of two terms: initial burst and diffusional release. On the other hand, a more complex model proposed for tri-phasic release from neat PLGA consists of burst release, degradative (relaxation-induced) drug dissolution release and diffusional release. Finally, this very first model to predict release from blend of PLGA and PCL was developed based on a heuristic approach. Drug distribution between PCL-rich and PLGA-rich phases is dictated by partition coefficient, and the overall fraction of drug release is a summation of drug released from the two phases. The proposed models exhibited good prediction of the experimental data.},

Despite the advantages of pure PLA in a wider spectrum of applications, it is limited by its hydrophobicity, low impact toughness, and slow degradation rate. Blending PLA with other polymers offers a convenient option to enhance its properties or generate novel properties for target applications without the need to develop new materials. PLA blends with different natural and synthetic polymers have been developed by solvent and melt blending techniques and further processed based on end-use applications. A variety of PLA blends has been explored for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, implants, sutures, and tissue engineering. This review discusses the opportunities for PLA blends in the biomedical arena, including the overview of blending and postblend processing techniques and the applications of PLA blends currently in use and under development.},

A technique for measuring the work of adhesion (Wa) between nanoparticles and their matrixes was used to determine the dispersion preference of the nanoparticles in the PLA/PBAT blend system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of thin sections indicated that even though both RDP-coated nanotubes and clay platelets segregated to the interfacial regions between the two immiscible polymers, only the platelets, having the larger specific surface area, were able to reduce the PBAT domain sizes. The ability of clay platelets to partially compatibilize the blend was further confirmed by the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) which showed that the glass transition temperatures of two polymers tended to shift closer. No shift was observed with either coated or uncoated HNTs samples. Izod impact testing demonstrated that the rubbery PBAT phase greatly increased the impact strength of the unfilled blend, but addition of only 5\% of treated clay decreased the impact strength by nearly 50\%. On the other hand, an increase of 9\% relative to the unfilled blend sample was observed with the addition of 5\% treated nanotubes. TEM cross-section analysis confirmed that the RDP-coated clay platelets covered most of the interfacial area. On one hand, this enabled them to reduce the interfacial tension effectively; on the other hand, it prevented chain entanglements across the phase boundary and increased the overall brittleness, which was confirmed by rheology measurements. In contrast, the RDP-coated HNTs were observed to lie perpendicular to the interface, which made them less effective in reducing interfacial tension but encouraged interfacial entanglements across the interface, resulting in “stitching” of the interface and an increase in the Izod impact of the blend.},

Therefore, toughening PLA has attracted more and more attention and various materials have been used to blend with PLA for toughening. Considering the fact that the use of petroleum-based species to toughen PLA would partially sacrifice the sustainability, various renewable polymers have recently been employed to toughen PLA. A series of important achievements have been obtained but not reviewed. This article aims to review progress in toughening PLA with renewable polymers.

	abstract = {Poly(lactide) (PLA), a compostable bioderived polyester, can be produced at a cost and scale that makes it an attractive replacement for nondegradable petroleum-derived thermoplastics. However, pristine PLA is brittle and unsuitable for use in applications where high impact strength and ductility are required. In this work we demonstrate that poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) in the glassy state can be toughened significantly via addition of an amphiphilic diblock polymer. Notably, a PLLA blend containing only 5 wt\% poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(butylene oxide) (PEO–PBO) exhibited tensile toughness and notched Izod impact strength over an order of magnitude higher than neat amorphous PLLA without a significant reduction in transparency or elastic modulus. For a series of PLLA blends containing PEO–PBO of fixed composition (∼70\% volume fraction PBO), the toughness was inversely related to the molar mass of the added modifier with the highest toughness observed for the blend containing the smallest diblock (∼7 kg/mol). Interestingly, at fixed composition and molar mass poly(l-lactide)-b-poly(butylene oxide) (PLLA–PBO) exhibited a substantial but reduced toughening efficiency compared to PEO–PBO. We attribute this difference to a change in the solubility parameter of the amphiphilc block. Using TEM, we show that the greatest toughening is observed when the diblock modifier forms small cylindrical micelles that are well dispersed in the PLLA matrix. This morphology is facilitated by a negative Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) between PEO and PLLA. These insights suggest a new and versatile strategy for the facile and efficient toughening of brittle thermoplastics.},

However, in some cases, their preparation requires the use of harsh processing conditions (e.g., high temperature), which limits their biomedical application. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to form elastomeric networks from poly(glycerol-co-sebacate) acrylate (PGSA) under mild conditions while preserving a wide range of physical properties. These networks presented a Young's modulus between 0.05 and 1.38 MPa, an ultimate strength from 0.05 to 0.50 Mpa, and elongation at break between 42\% and 189\% strain, by varying the degree of acrylation (DA) of PGSA. The in vitro enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation of the polymer networks was dependent on the DA. The copolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with PGSA allowed for an additional control of mechanical properties and swelling ratios in an aqueous environment, as well as enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation. Photocured PGSA networks demonstrated in vitro biocompatibility as judged by sufficient human primary cell adherence and subsequent proliferation into a confluent monolayer. These photocurable degradable elastomers could have potential application for the encapsulation of temperature-sensitive factors and cells for tissue engineering.},

Evidence for open groin hernia repair demonstrates less pain with bioglue mesh fixation compared with invasive methods. This study aimed to assess the short- and long-term effects of laparoscopic groin hernia repair with noninvasive and invasive mesh fixation.
Data Sources
A systematic review of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and OpenGrey was undertaken. Randomized trials assessing the outcome of laparoscopic groin hernia repair with invasive and noninvasive fixation methods were considered for data synthesis. Nine trials encompassing 1,454 patients subjected to laparoscopic hernia repair with mesh fixation using biologic or biosynthetic glue were identified. Short-term data were inadequate for data synthesis. Chronic pain was less frequently reported by patients subjected to repair with biologic glue fixation than with penetrating methods (odds ratio .46, 95\% confidence interval .22 to .93). Duration of surgery, incidence of seroma/hematoma, morbidity, and recurrence were similar.
Conclusions
Laparoscopic groin hernia repair with bioglue mesh fixation was associated with a reduced incidence of chronic pain compared with mechanical fixation, without increasing morbidity or recurrence. Longer term data on recurrence are necessary.},

Material and Methods: In 36 New Zealand White rabbits, 3 × 3 cm (n = 24) or 1.5 × 3 cm (n = 12) fragments of ePTFE mesh (Preclude®, Gore, Flagstaff, USA) were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using OCA or Ifabond®. Peritoneal fluid was obtained at the time of implant and at 2 weeks postimplant for determination of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). At 14 or 90 days postsurgery, the animals were euthanized and the meshes excised to assess host tissue incorporation, the macrophage response, apoptosis and fixation strength (T-peel tensiometry). Results: Peritoneal fluid IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations were similar in the OCA and Ifabond® groups. Both adhesives gave rise to adequate mesothelialization of the laminar ePTFE. Macrophage counts were similar for the two study groups, but a significantly increase in macrophage response was observed from 14 to 90 days for Ifabond®. At 90 days postimplant, apoptotic cell counts was lower for the implants fixed with OCA and a fixation strength was significantly lower for OCA. Conclusions: Despite similar cytokine levels at 2 weeks and similar host tissue incorporation observed for the meshes fixed with the two adhesives, the use of Ifabond® gave rise to a greater apoptosis rate, although this adhesive provided a stronger fixation bond. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The less traumatic use of surgical adhesives rather than sutures for mesh fixation in hernia repair has started to gain popularity because they induce less host tissue damage and provoke less postoperative pain. This study examines the host tissue response to a new cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesive (n-octyl, OCA). Partial defects (3 × 5 cm) created in the rabbit anterior abdominal wall were repaired by mesh fixation using OCA, Glubran2®(n-butyl-CA), Ifabond®(n-hexyl-CA) or sutures. Samples were obtained at 14/90 days for morphology, collagens qRT-PCR/immunofluorescence and biomechanical studies. All meshes were successfully fixed. Seroma was detected mainly in the Glubran group at 14 days. Meshes fixed using all methods showed good host tissue incorporation. No signs of degradation of any of the adhesives were observed. At 14 days, collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression levels were greater in the suture and OCA groups, and lower in Ifabond, with levels varying significantly in the latter group with respect to the others. By 90 days, expression levels had fallen in all groups, except for collagen 3 mRNA in Ifabond. Collagen I and III protein expression was marked in the suture and OCA groups at 90 days, but lower in Ifabond at both time points. Tensile strengths were similar across groups. Our findings indicate the similar behavior of the adhesives to sutures in terms of good tissue incorporation of the meshes and optimal repair zone strength. The lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to controls induced by OCA suggests its improved behavior over the other two glues.Graphical AbstractThis article deals with a preclinical study to examine different aspects of the repair process in the host of three alkyl cyanoacrylates (n-butyl (GLUBRAN 2), n-hexyl (IFABOND), and n-octyl cyanoacrylate (EVOBOND)) compared to sutures (control), in the fixation of surgical meshes for hernia repair. It goes into detail about collagen deposition in the repair zone at short and medium term. The results obtained demonstrate lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to sutures induced by the n-octyl suggesting better behavior than the other two cyanoacrylates.

Mesh fixation using tissue adhesives (TA) that replace conventional sutures may improve the process of hernia repair and tissue trauma. This preclinical study compares the behavior of different cyanoacrylate-based adhesives in the fixation of LW-PP meshes for hernia repair. Methods Partial abdominal wall defects were repaired using LW-PP Optilene meshes in New Zealand rabbits. The following groups were established according to the mesh fixation method: Suture (control), Glubran 2 (n-butyl), Ifabond (n-hexyl), SafetySeal (n-butyl) and Evobond (n-octyl). At 14, 90 and 180 days after surgery, the recovered implants were examined to assess the host tissue integration, the macrophage response and the biomechanical strength. Results All the groups showed optimal host tissue incorporation regardless of the fixation procedure. Significantly increased levels of collagen 1 and collagen 3 gene expression (p{\textless}0.001) were observed at 14 days compared to the medium- and long-term durations, where the Suture and Glubran groups showed the highest expression of collagen 1. All the adhesives increased the macrophage reaction (p{\textless}0.001) compared to sutures at all implant times. Maximal macrophage response was observed in the short-term Glubran group (p{\textless}0.01) compared to the rest of the groups. Although SafetySeal and Evobond did not reach the biomechanical resistance of sutures at 14 days, all the adhesives did reach this level in the medium- to long-term periods, providing significantly higher resistance (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions All the cyanoacrylates, despite inducing a significantly increased macrophage response versus sutures, showed optimal host tissue integration and long-term mechanical behavior; thus, they might be good choices for LW-PP mesh hernia repairs.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Cyanoacrylate has been used as a commercial tissue adhesive. Recently, ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate has been suggested for the fixation of onlay autogenous bone graft. However, ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate must be biocompatible with bone tissue. This study evaluated the cytotoxicity of cyanoacrylate adhesives using a direct contact assay on human oral osteoblast cells.
Materials and Methods
Osteoblastic cells derived from human alveolar bone of the mandible were cultured with or without cyanoacrylate. The CA1 group contained methyl 2-cyanoacrylate, the CA2 group contained ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, and the CA3 group did not contain cyanoacrylate (control). This study investigated cell morphology, which included the inhibition zone, and cytotoxicity was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which was measured as optical density. Data from the MTT assay were tested statistically using SigmaStat 3.5.
Results
Dead cells found around the CA1- and CA2-treated cells constituted inhibitory zones that varied from 200 to 500 μm. There was no inhibitory zone in the CA3 group. Cell viability evaluated by the MTT assay showed that the CA2 and CA3 optical densities were not significantly different. The CA1 optical densities differed significantly from the CA3 optical densities.
Conclusions
Within the limits of this study, the MTT method supported the conclusion that ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate is biocompatible according to a direct contact assay on human osteoblast cell cultures and suggests its usefulness in bone graft fixation.},

	abstract = {IntroductionBone graft is a very common procedure that is performed when bone volume needs to be increased before a dental implant. Screws and miniplates are the clinical standards for osteosynthesis. However, some disadvantages for this method have been reported, including artifacts on radiological images, infection, screw loosening, and the need to remove screws that interfere with the dental implants. Bone adhesives are a promising alternative for bone graft surgery.PurposeThe aim of this study was to compare the shear bond strength of two cyanoacrylate-based adhesives and titanium screws for bone graft fixation.MethodsPig jaw samples were cut into rectangular bars (2 × 6 × 20 mm) and bonded with a 5-mm overlap of N-butyl cyanoacrylate and ethyl cyanoacrylate, and 1.5-mm titanium screws were inserted into the center of the contact area. The blocks were fixed on a shear bond strength device that was coupled to a universal testing machine. The maximum force (N) was recorded on a computer and divided by the bonded area (in mm2) in order to calculate the bond strength (MPa). The data were statistically analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05).ResultsThe shear bond strengths of the screws were significantly higher than both cyanoacrylate adhesives, which presented statistically similar bond strength means, and have the biomechanical potential to be used for bone fixation.ConclusionsEthyl cyanoacrylate is an inexpensive adhesive that has multiple purposes and can be considered as an alternative for bone fixation.},

The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility and safety of tissue cyanoacrylate glue versus absorbable sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernioplasty. Methods: Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed under local anaesthesia as a day-case operation in one of three hospitals. The patients were randomized to receive either absorbable polyglycolic acid 3/0 sutures (Dexon®; 151 hernias) or 1 ml butyl-2-cyanoacrylate tissue glue (Glubran®; 151 hernias) for fixation of lightweight mesh (Optilene®). Wound complications, pain, discomfort and recurrence were identified at 1 and 7 days, 1 month and 1 year after surgery. Results: A total of 302 patients were included in the study. The mean(s.d.) duration of operation was 34(12) min in the glue group and 36(13) min in the suture group (P = 0·113). The need for analgesics was similar during the first 24 h after surgery. Five wound infections (3·4 per cent) were detected in the glue group and two (1·4 per cent) in the suture group (P = 0·448). The recurrence rate at 1 year was 1·4 per cent in each group (P = 1·000). The rates of foreign body sensation, acute and chronic pain were similar in the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the type of mesh fixation did not predict chronic pain 1 year after surgery. Conclusion: Mesh fixation without sutures in Lichtenstein hernioplasty was feasible without compromising postoperative outcome. Registration number: NCT00659542 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

	abstract = {Background
Synthetic tissue adhesives (TA) are sometimes used in hernia repair surgery. This study compares the use of a new, noncommercial, long-chain cyanoacrylate (n-octyl) TA and Ifabond for mesh fixation.
Materials and methods
In two implant models in the rabbit, expanded polytetrafluorethylene meshes were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using a TA or tacks (intraperitoneal model), or polypropylene meshes used to repair partial abdominal wall defects were fixed with a TA or sutures (extraperitoneal model). Animals were euthanized 14 or 90 d postsurgery and implant specimens were processed for microscopy (labeling of macrophages and apoptotic cells), peritoneal fluid and biomechanical strength testing. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were determinated in peritoneal fluid.
Results
Mesothelial cell deposition on the intraperitoneal implants fixed using the new TA and Ifabond was adequate and similar IL-6 and TNF-α levels were detected in these implants. Intraperitoneal meshes fixed with tacks showed IL-6 overexpression. Three months after surgery, macrophage and apoptotic cell rates were higher for the intraperitoneal implants fixed with Ifabond versus the new TA or tacks. In the extraperitoneal model, reduced macrophage and cell damage responses were observed in the meshes fixed with sutures versus both TA. Tensile strengths were greater for the tacks versus TA in the intraperitoneal implants and similar for the sutures and TA in the extraperitoneal implants (90 d).
Conclusions
Both TA showed a good cell response in both models. Their use in an intraperitoneal location resulted in reduced tensile strength compared with the tacks. However, strengths were comparable when extraperitoneal implants were fixed with these adhesives or sutures.},

Modeled after a natural adhesive secreted by the sandcastle worm, we studied the biocompatibility of adhesive complex coacervates in vitro and in vivo with two different rat calvarial models. We found that the adhesive was non-cytotoxic and supported the attachment, spreading, and migration of a commonly used osteoblastic cell line over the course of several days. In animal studies we found that the adhesive was capable of maintaining three-dimensional bone alignment in freely moving rats over a 12 week indwelling period. Histological evidence indicated that the adhesive was gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone that became lamellar across the defect without loss of alignment, changes in volume, or changes in the adjacent uninjured bone. The presence of inflammatory cells was consistent with what has been reported with other craniofacial fixation methods including metal plates, screws, tacks, calcium phosphate cements and cyanoacrylate adhesives. Collectively, the results suggest that the new bioadhesive formulation is degradable, osteoconductive and appears suitable for use in the reconstruction of craniofacial fractures.},

	abstract = {Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is an easily applied, biocompatible, bioresorbable polymer glue that provides an alternative to conventional rigid fixation techniques. Our aim was to determine if cyanoacrylate fixation of the bone flap in a rabbit craniotomy model provides the healing and strength afforded by plate and screw fixation. We also investigated the inflammatory responses of adjacent tissues including the scalp, cranium, and brain. A unilateral parietal bone flap was elevated in 33 adult New Zealand rabbits. The bone was fixed in position with cyanoacrylate (n = 13), fixed with a microplate and screws (n = 14), or was replaced without fixation (sham-control, n = 6). Normal scar formation and no residual polymer were found in scalp specimens. Neuropathologic analysis identified the presence of residual polymer on the surface of 2 of the 13 rabbit brains. Histopathologic analysis of the bone flap-to-skull interface revealed no difference in the degree but rather in the quality of inflammation and healing between the plate and screw and polymer fixation groups. Microdensitometric analysis of the bone gap revealed nearly equivalent bone density in the cyanoacrylate and plated groups, tending to less density in the sham group (p = 0.11 and 0.09, respectively). An additional study focusing on neurotoxicity was performed in 20 adult rabbits with 3-week and 11-week recovery periods and similarly found the absence of a marked inflammatory response to the polymer. In conclusion, bone healing and soft-tissue inflammation were comparable between cyanoacrylate and plate and screw fixation groups. Although butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue fixation may provide a reasonable alternative to hardware fixation, further investigations are necessary to identify its ideal utilization.},

	abstract = {Delivery of tissue glues through small-bore needles or trocars is critical for sealing holes, affixing medical devices, or attaching tissues together during minimally invasive surgeries. Inspired by the granule-packaged glue delivery system of sandcastle worms, a nanoparticulate formulation of a viscous hydrophobic light-activated adhesive based on poly(glycerol sebacate)-acrylate is developed. Negatively charged alginate is used to stabilize the nanoparticulate surface to significantly reduce its viscosity and to maximize injectability through small-bore needles. The nanoparticulate glues can be concentrated to ≈30 w/v\% dispersions in water that remain localized following injection. With the trigger of a positively charged polymer (e.g., protamine), the nanoparticulate glues can quickly assemble into a viscous glue that exhibits rheological, mechanical, and adhesive properties resembling the native poly(glycerol sebacate)-acrylate based glues. This platform should be useful to enable the delivery of viscous glues to augment or replace sutures and staples during minimally invasive procedures.},

Given this limited healing response, the development of biologically active adjuncts to meniscal repair may hold the key to improving meniscal repair success rates. This study demonstrates the development of a bone marrow (BM) adhesive that binds, stabilizes, and stimulates fusion at the interface of meniscus tissues. Hydrogels containing several chondroitin sulfate (CS) adhesive levels (30, 50, and 70 mg/mL) and BM levels (30\%, 50\%, and 70\%) were formed to investigate the effects of these components on hydrogel mechanics, bovine meniscal fibrochondrocyte viability, proliferation, matrix production, and migration ability in vitro. The BM content positively and significantly affected fibrochondrocyte viability, proliferation, and migration, while the CS content positively and significantly affected adhesive strength (ranged from 60±17 kPa to 335±88 kPa) and matrix production. Selected material formulations were translated to a subcutaneous model of meniscal fusion using adhered bovine meniscus explants implanted in athymic rats and evaluated over a 3-month time course. Fusion of adhered meniscus occurred in only the material containing the highest BM content. The technology can serve to mechanically stabilize the tissue repair interface and stimulate tissue regeneration across the injury site.},

	abstract = {Gelatin is widely used as a medical biomaterial because it is readily available, cheap, biodegradable and demonstrates favourable biocompatibility. Many applications require stabilisation of the biomaterial by chemical crosslinking, and this often involves derivatisation of the protein or treatment with cytotoxic crosslinking agents. We have previously shown that a facile photochemical method, using blue light, a ruthenium catalyst and a persulphate oxidant, produces covalent di-tyrosine crosslinks in resilin and fibrinogen to form stable hydrogel biomaterials. Here we show that various gelatins can also be rapidly crosslinked to form highly elastic (extension to break {\textgreater}650\%) and adhesive (stress at break {\textgreater}100kPa) biomaterials. Although the method does not require derivatisation of the protein, we show that when the phenolic (tyrosine-like) content of gelatin is increased, the crosslinked material becomes resistant to swelling, yet retains considerable elasticity and high adhesive strength. The reagents are not cytotoxic at the concentration used in the photopolymerisation reaction. When tested in vivo in sheep lung, the photopolymerised gelatin effectively sealed a wound in lung tissue from blood and air leakage, was not cytotoxic and did not produce an inflammatory response. The elastic properties, thermal stability, speed of curing and high tissue adhesive strength of this photopolymerised gelatin, offer considerable improvement over current surgical tissue sealants.},

The injectable material, MeTro, successfully sealed surgical incisions in blood vessels in rats and in lungs in pigs without evidence of leakage or rupture.

	abstract = {The pressure sensitive adhesion characteristic of a protein complex extracted from squid ring teeth (SRT), which exhibits an unusual and reversible transition from a solid to a melt, is studied. The native SRT is an elastomeric protein complex that has standard amino acids, and it does not function as adhesives in nature. The SRT can be thermally shaped into any 3D geometry (e.g., thin films, ribbons, colloids), and it has a glass transition temperature of 32 °C in water. Underwater adhesion strength of the protein film is approximately 1.5–2.5 MPa. The thermoplastic protein film could potentially be used in an array of fields, including dental resins, bandages for wound healing, and surgical sutures in the body.},

	abstract = {The development of adhesives that can be applied and create strong bonds underwater is a significant challenge for materials engineering. When the adhesive is intended for biomedical applications, further criteria, such as biocompatibility, must be met. Current biomedical adhesive technologies do not meet these needs. In response, we designed a bioinspired protein system that shows promise to achieve biocompatible underwater adhesion coupled with environmentally responsive behavior that is “smart” – that is, it can be tuned to suit a specific application. The material, ELY16, is constructed from an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) that can be produced in high yields from Escherichia coli and can coacervate in response to environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and salinity. To confer wet adhesion, we utilized design principles from marine organisms such as mussels and sandcastle worms. When expressed, ELY16 is rich in tyrosine. Upon modification with the tyrosinase enzyme to form mELY16, the tyrosine residues are converted to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Both ELY16 and mELY16 exhibit cytocompatibility and significant dry adhesion strength ({\textgreater}2 MPa). Modification with DOPA increases protein adsorption to glass and provides moderate adhesion strength (∼240 kPa) in a highly humid environment. Furthermore, this ELP exhibits a tunable phase transition behavior that can be formulated to coacervate in physiological conditions and provides a convenient mechanism for application underwater. Finally, mELY16 possesses significantly higher adhesion strength in dry, humid, and underwater environments compared with a commercially available fibrin sealant. To our knowledge, mELY16 provides the strongest bonds of any rationally designed protein when used completely underwater, and its high yields make it more viable for commercial application compared to natural adhesive proteins. In conclusion, this ELP shows great potential to be a new “smart” underwater adhesive.},

	abstract = {Tissue adhesives are a versatile and valuable alternative for wound closure. With fast application, the prevention of body fluid leakage and additional trauma to the wound, adhesives are desirable, especially in friable tissues. Although several options are already in the market, these present some drawbacks, namely poor adhesion in wet substrates and toxicity. Here, the main adhesives both synthetic and biomimetic, commercially available and those still in research, are analyzed with a focus on their adhesion mechanisms. At present, the strongest adhesive able to replace sutures in skin wounds is cyanoacrylate based. However it is toxic and therefore cannot be used internally. More recently alternatives have emerged, with PEG-based adhesives being biocompatible but mainly used as tissue sealants due to their low strength. The most recent approaches under development try to mimic the adhesion strategies of several organisms, such as the extensively studied blue mussels, sandcastle worms, barnacles and geckos. Although no ideal results have been achieved so far, large improvements have been accomplished in the last decade and research is reaching to a new level where the results are starting to meet the needs for medical applications.},

Here, we review some typical peeling models and the correlation of bulk viscoelastic properties to peel, shear and tack. Different factors affecting bonding and debonding properties of PSAs are examined in light of their relevance to rheological properties. The effects of substrate surface roughness are also reviewed. At last, some important new characterization methods together with rheology will be discussed.},

Coumarone–indene resin, gum rosin, and petro resin were used as tackifiers. Toluene was used as the solvent throughout the experiment. The adhesive was coated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using a SHEEN hand coater. Viscosity was determined by a HAAKE Rotary Viscometer, whereas loop tack was measured by a Llyod Adhesion Tester operating at 10 cm/min. Results show that viscosity increases gradually upto a critical molecular weight of 6.8 × 104 and 3.9 × 104 for ENR 25 and ENR 50, respectively, before a rapid increase in viscosity is observed. Loop tack indicates maximum value at the respective critical molecular weights for the three tackifiers investigated suggesting the culmination of wettability. For both rubbers, loop tack increases with coating thickness due to the concentration effect of adhesive. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010},

Initially, hydroxy telechelic polymenthide was synthesized by the diethylene glycol-initiated and tin(II) ethylhexanoate-catalyzed polymerization of menthide. The resulting 100 kg mol−1 polymer was used as a macroinitiator for the tin(II) ethylhexanoate-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of d,l-lactide. Two polylactide−polymenthide−polylactide triblock copolymers were prepared with 5 and 10 kg mol−1 polylactide end blocks. Transesterification between the two blocks, and polylactide homopolymer formation were minimized, and triblock copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions were produced. Microphase separation in these systems was corroborated by differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements. The triblocks were combined with up to 60 wt \% of a renewable tackifier, and the resulting mixtures were evaluated using probe tack, 180° peel adhesion, and shear strength tests. Maximum values of peel adhesion (3.2 N cm−1) and tack (1.1 N) were obtained at 40 wt \% of tackifier. These new materials hold promise as renewable and hydrolytically degradable pressure-sensitive adhesives.},

Thus, the goal of this study was to create a user friendly ImageJ/FIJI plugin that would analyze SEM micrographs of nanofibers to determine nanofiber diameter on a desktop computer within 60 s. Additional design goals included 1) compatibility with a variety of existing segmentation algorithms, and 2) an open source code to enable further improvement of the plugin. Using existing algorithms for centerline determination, Euclidean distance transforms and a novel pixel transformation technique, a plugin called “DiameterJ” was created for ImageJ/FIJI. The plugin was validated using 1) digital synthetic images of white lines on a black background and 2) SEM images of nominally monodispersed steel wires of known diameters. DiameterJ analyzed SEM micrographs in 20 s, produced diameters not statistically different from known values, was over 10-times closer to known diameter values than other open source software, provided hundreds of times the sampling of manual measurement, and was hundreds of times faster than manual assessment of nanofiber diameter. DiameterJ enables users to rapidly and thoroughly determine the structural features of nanofiber scaffolds and could potentially allow new insights to be formed into fiber diameter distribution and cell response.},

The majority of these young children suffer from superficial and deep partial thickness scald burns that may easily deepen to full thickness burns. A proper wound therapy, that prevents infection and ensures a moist wound condition, might prevent the deterioration of the wound. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of wound management and dressing materials to select the best treatment option for children with burns. A search in Medline and Embase revealed 51 articles for a critical appraisal. The articles were divided into randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and a group of case-reports. Total appraisal did not differ much amongst the groups; the level of evidence was highest in the randomized controlled trials and lowest in the case-reports. In 16 out of 34 comparative studies, silver sulfadiazine or a silver sulfadiazine/chlorhexidine-gluconate combination was the standard of wound care treatment. The competitor dressing was Biobrane® in six studies and amnion membrane in three. Tulle gauze, or tulle gauze impregnated with an antibacterial addition were the standard of care treatment in seven studies. In general, membranous dressings like Biobrane® and amnion membrane performed better than the standard of care on epithelialization rate, length of hospital stay and pain for treatment of partial thickness burns in children. However, hardly any of the studies investigated long-term results like scar formation.},

	abstract = {Infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms result in significant increases in mortality, morbidity, and cost related to prolonged treatments. The antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles against some drug-resistant bacteria has been established, but further investigation is needed to determine whether these particles could be an option for the treatment and prevention of drug-resistant microbial infections. Hence, we challenged different drug-resistant pathogens of clinical importance (multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli O157:H7 and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes) with a suspension of silver nanoparticles. By means of a luciferase-based assay, it was determined that silver nanoparticles (1) inactivate a panel of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative), (2) exert their antibacterial activity through a bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic mechanism, and (3) inhibit the bacterial growth rate from the time of first contact between the bacteria and the nanoparticles. Additionally, strains with a resistant phenotype to silver nanoparticle were developed and used to explore the bactericidal mode of action of silver nanoparticles. Through a Kirby–Bauer test, it was shown that silver nanoparticles’ general mechanism of bactericidal action is based on inhibition of cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis mediated by the 30s ribosomal subunit, and nucleic acid synthesis. Our data suggest that silver nanoparticles are effective broad-spectrum biocides against a variety of drug-resistant bacteria, which makes them a potential candidate for use in pharmaceutical products and medical devices that may help to prevent the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens in different clinical environments.},

	abstract = {Silver nanoparticles, which are being used increasingly as antimicrobial agents, may extend its antibacterial application to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the main cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. To explore the antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles against MRSA, the present work includes an analysis of the relation between nanosilver effect and MRSA’s resistance mechanisms, a study of the size dependence of the bactericidal activity of nanosilver and a toxicity assessment of nanoparticles against epithelial human cells. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and MBC/MIC ratio of silver nanoparticles were quantified by using a luciferase-based assay. The cytotoxic effect (CC50 and CC90) of three different nanosilver sizes (10, 30–40, and 100 nm) were assessed in HeLa cells by a similar method. The therapeutic index was used as an indicator of nanosilver overall efficacy and safety. Silver nanoparticles inhibited bacterial growth of both MRSA and non-MR S. aureus in a bactericidal rather than a bacteriostatic manner (MBC/MIC ratio ≤ 4). Silver nanoparticle’s therapeutic index varied when nanoparticle’s size diminished. At the same dose range, 10 nm nanoparticles were the most effective since they did not affect HeLa’s cell viability while inhibiting a considerable percentage of MRSA growth. Silver nanoparticles are effective bactericidal agents that are not affected by drug-resistant mechanisms of MRSA. Nanosilver size mediates MRSA inhibition and the cytotoxicity to human cells, being smaller nanoparticles the ones with a better antibacterial activity and nontoxic effect.},

	abstract = {Commercially available surgical sealants for internal use either lack sufficient adhesion or produce cytotoxicity. This work describes a surgical sealant based on a polymer blend of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that increases wet tissue adherence by incorporation of nano-to-microscale silica particles, without significantly affecting cell viability, biodegradation rate, or local inflammation. In functional studies, PLGA/PEG/silica composite sealants produce intestinal burst pressures that are comparable to cyanoacrylate glue (160 mmHg), ∼2 times greater than the non-composite sealant (59 mmHg), and ∼3 times greater than fibrin glue (49 mmHg). The addition of silica to PLGA/PEG is compatible with a sprayable in situ deposition method called solution blow spinning and decreases coagulation time in vitro and in vivo. These improvements are biocompatible and cause minimal additional inflammation, demonstrating the potential of a simple composite design to increase adhesion to wet tissue through physical, noncovalent mechanisms and enable use in procedures requiring simultaneous occlusion and hemostasis.
Statement of Significance
Incorporating silica particles increases the tissue adhesion of a polymer blend surgical sealant. The particles enable interfacial physical bonding with tissue and enhance the flexibility of the bulk of the sealant, without significantly affecting cytotoxicity, inflammation, or biodegradation. These studies also demonstrate how silica particles decrease blood coagulation time. This surgical sealant improves upon conventional devices because it can be easily deposited with accuracy directly onto the surgical site as a solid polymer fiber mat. The deposition method, solution blow spinning, allows for high loading in the composite fibers, which are sprayed from a polymer blend solution containing suspended silica particles. These findings could easily be translated to other implantable or wearable devices due to the versatility of silica particles.},

Poor wound healing after trauma, surgery, acute illness, or chronic disease conditions affects millions of people worldwide each year and is the consequence of poorly regulated elements of the healthy tissue repair response, including inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix deposition, and cell recruitment. Failure of one or several of these cellular processes is generally linked to an underlying clinical condition, such as vascular disease, diabetes, or aging, which are all frequently associated with healing pathologies. The search for clinical strategies that might improve the body's natural repair mechanisms will need to be based on a thorough understanding of the basic biology of repair and regeneration.

	volume = {22},

	doi = {10.1111/acem.12723},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Second-degree burns are very common but their management is controversial. These burns may be treated with either topical antimicrobial agents or advanced occlusive dressings; however, there is no established treatment comparator for preclinical studies. This study was designed to determine which of two commonly used comparator therapies (a silver-containing advanced dressing or a topical antibiotic ointment) resulted in faster reepithelialization and less scarring. The hypothesis was that second-degree burns treated with a topical antimicrobial ointment would heal faster and with less scarring than those treated with a silver-containing occlusive foam dressing in a porcine model.
METHODS: Deep partial-thickness burns were created on the flanks of three anesthetized female domestic pigs (20 to 25 kg) using a 150-g aluminum bar preheated in 80°C water bath and applied to the skin for 20 seconds using a force of 2 kg. The burn eschars were excised 48 hours later with an electric dermatome set at a depth of 0.75 mm. The wound beds were treated with a thin layer of triple-antibiotic petrolatum-based ointment (changed three times weekly) or a silver-containing foam dressing (changed once weekly). Full-thickness punch biopsies were obtained at 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, and 21 days for determination of percentage complete wound reepithelialization and at 28 days for measurement of scar depth.
RESULTS: At all dressing changes the wounds treated with the topical antibiotic appeared moist, while those treated with the silver-based dressings appeared dry. At day 21 all wounds treated with the ointment were completely reepithelialized, while only 55\% of those treated with the silver dressing were reepithelialized (p {\textless} 0.001). Scar depth at day 28 was also significantly less in wounds treated with the topical antibiotic ointment (4.3 mm vs. 5.1 mm, difference = 0.7 mm; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1 to 1.4 mm). There was less scar contraction in wounds treated with the topical antibiotic compared with the silver-based dressing (mean ± SD = 25.0\% ± 14.6\% vs. 38.9\% ± 16.9\%, difference = 13.9\%; 95\% CI = 5.7\% to 22.0\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this model of excised deep partial-thickness burns, a triple-antibiotic ointment enhanced reepithelialization and reduced scar depth and contraction compared with a silver-based foam dressing. This triple-antibiotic ointment should be considered as a control for studies evaluating novel topical burn therapies.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of hypertrophic scar reduction using silicone gel sheeting remains elusive. We hypothesize that the decrease in scar formation is due to occlusion and homeostasis of the barrier layer. Using an established model of hypertrophic scarring, rabbits were divided into four groups and scars were tape-stripped or occluded with Kelocote, Cavilon, or Indermil, with each rabbit serving as its own internal control. All wounds were harvested on day 28 and examined histologically to measure the scar elevation index (SEI), epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunohistochemistry ﬂuorescence was used to quantify inﬂammation in the dermis. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured for each occlusive agent and tape stripping. Ultrastructural analysis was performed by electron microscopy. Kelocote, Cavilon, and Indermil all significantly decreased SEI when compared with controls. Each of the occlusive treatments was shown to decrease TEWL while tape stripping increased TEWL. Tape stripping significantly increased the SEI, epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunostaining for macrophages showed increased density of inﬂammatory cells in the tape-stripped scars. Under electron microscopy, the tape-stripped wounds displayed extensive inﬂammation and keratinocyte damage. Both unwounded skin and occlusiontreated scars did not display these characteristics. In conclusion, hypertrophic scarring was reduced regardless of occlusive method used. Furthermore, repeated disruption of the permeability barrier by tape stripping led to an increase in scarring. Ultrastructural analysis suggests that occluded wounds may be in an advanced state of wound repair. Occlusion may mediate its effects through establishing homeostasis of the epidermal barrier layer.},

After an injury, multiple biological pathways immediately become activated and are synchronized to respond. In human adults, the wound repair process commonly leads to a non-functioning mass of fibrotic tissue known as a scar. By contrast, early in gestation, injured fetal tissues can be completely recreated, without fibrosis, in a process resembling regeneration. Some organisms, however, retain the ability to regenerate tissue throughout adult life. Knowledge gained from studying such organisms might help to unlock latent regenerative pathways in humans, which would change medical practice as much as the introduction of antibiotics did in the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis is critical to wound repair. Newly formed blood vessels participate in provisional granulation tissue formation and provide nutrition and oxygen to growing tissues. In addition, inﬂammatory cells require the interaction with and transmigration through the endothelial basement membrane to enter the site of injury. Angiogenesis, in response to tissue injury, is a dynamic process that is highly regulated by signals from both serum and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin, ﬁbroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta are among those most potent angiogenic cytokines in wound angiogenesis. The cooperative regulation of them is essential for wound repair. Migration of endothelial cells and development of new capillary vessels during wound repair is dependent on not only the cells and cytokines present but also the production and organization of ECM components both in granulation tissue and in endothelial basement membrane. The ECM regulates angiogenesis by providing scaffold support and signaling roles. They also serve as a reservoir and modulator for growth factors. Laminins are the major noncollagenous ECM of endothelial basement membrane. Two newly recognized laminins, 8 and 10, are the major laminins produced by human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Laminin 10 is highly expressed in blood vessels around skin wounds. Laminin 8 promotes dermal endothelial cell attachment, migration, and tubule formation. Integrins with either beta 1 or alpha v subunits are the major cellular surface receptors for ECM molecules and mediate the interactions between cells and ECM during wound angiogenesis. Microsc. Res.

Several pieces of evidence suggest that lactate actively participates in the healing process through the activation of several molecular pathways that collectively promote angiogenesis. Lactate indeed stimulates endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro, as well as the recruitment of circulating vascular progenitor cells and vascular morphogenesis in vivo. In this study, we examined whether the pro-angiogenic potential of lactate may be exploited therapeutically to accelerate wound healing. We show that lactate delivered from a Matrigel matrix improves reperfusion and opposes muscular atrophy in ischemic hindlimb wounds in mice. Both responses involve lactate-induced reparative angiogenesis. Using microdialysis and enzymatic measurements, we found that, contrary to poly-L-lactide (PLA), a subcutaneous implant of poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) allows sustained local and systemic lactate release. PLGA promoted angiogenesis and accelerated the closure of excisional skin wounds in different mouse strains. This polymer is FDA-approved for other applications, emphasizing the possibility of exploiting PLGA therapeutically to improve wound healing.},

Vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates (VEGF) wound healing via multiple mechanisms. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) supplies lactate that accelerates neovascularization and promotes wound healing. Hence, we hypothesized that the administration of VEGF encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles (PLGA-VEGF NP) would promote fast healing due to the sustained and combined effects of VEGF and lactate. In a splinted mouse full thickness excision model, compared with untreated, VEGF and PLGA NP, PLGA-VEGF NP treated wounds showed significant granulation tissue formation with higher collagen content, re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. The cellular and molecular studies revealed that PLGA-VEGF NP enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and upregulated the expression of VEGFR2 at mRNA level. We demonstrated the combined effects of lactate and VEGF for active healing of non-diabetic and diabetic wounds.
From the Clinical Editor
The study of wound healing has been under a tremendous amount of research over recent years. In diabetic wounds, vasculopathy leading to localized ischemia would often result in delayed wound healing. In this article, the authors encapsulated vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates (VEGF) in PLGA nanoparticles and studies the potential pro-healing effects. It was found that the combination of these two components provided synergistic actions for healing. The encouraging results should provide a basis for combination therapy in the future.},

	abstract = {Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is well known for its biocompatibility and minimal toxicity. It is one of the most promising biodegradable polymeric drug delivery systems able to get endorsement from regulatory bodies to enter market. For many decades, PLGA has been functioning as an excipient, which by definition is pharmaceutically inert at a given dose of formulation. Lactate (one of the hydrolysis products of PLGA) has a key role in biochemical pathways and could improve physiological activities in certain illnesses by exerting therapeutic effects such as angiogenesis and promotion of healing. These activities, however, depend on the released amounts and metabolic clearance of lactate and route of formulation delivery. In the current commentary, along with several key notes on the lactate interactions, we would like to inform the PLGA research community that lactate (resulting from local delivery of physiologically significant amount of PLGA) may positively or negatively affect therapeutic efficacy of certain drugs. Hence, the excipient role of PLGA may be investigated for its potential pharmacological contributions in some biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {Silver is a strong antibiotic that is increasingly incorporated into consumer products as a bulk, salt, or nanosilver, thus potentially causing side-effects related to human exposure. However, the fate and behavior of (nano)silver in the human body is presently not well understood. In order to aggregate the existing experimental information, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) was developed in this study for ionic silver and nanosilver. The structure of the model was established on the basis of toxicokinetic data from intravenous studies. The number of calibrated parameters was minimized in order to enhance the predictive capability of the model. We validated the model structure for both silver forms by reproducing exposure conditions (dermal, oral, and inhalation) of in vivo experiments and comparing simulated and experimentally assessed organ concentrations. Therefore, the percutaneous, intestinal, or pulmonary absorption fraction was estimated based on the blood silver concentration of the respective experimental data set. In all of the cases examined, the model could successfully predict the biodistribution of ionic silver and 15–150 nm silver nanoparticles, which were not coated with substances designed to prolong the circulatory time (eg, polyethylene glycol). Furthermore, the results of our model indicate that: (1) within the application domain of our model, the particle size and coating had a minor influence on the biodistribution; (2) in vivo, it is more likely that silver nanoparticles are directly stored as insoluble salt particles than dissolve into Ag+; and (3) compartments of the mononuclear phagocytic system play a minor role in exposure levels that are relevant for human consumers. We also give an example of how the model can be used in exposure and risk assessments based on five different exposure scenarios, namely dietary intake, use of three separate consumer products, and occupational exposure.},

To quantitatively determine the intrapolymer acidity, weentrapped pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes (conjugated to 10,000 Dadextrans) within the microspheres and imaged them with confocalfluorescence microscopy. The technique allows visualization of thespatial and temporal distribution of pH within the degradingmicrospheres (1).Results. Our experiments show the formation of a very acidicenvironment within the particles with the minimum pH as low as 1.5.Conclusions. The images show a pH gradient, with the most acidicenvironment at the center of the spheres and higher pH near the edges,which is characteristic of diffusion-controlled release of the acidicdegradation products.},

	abstract = {The peritoneum is a serous membrane, which has a protective function for the contents of the abdominal cavity. It maintains homeostasis by allowing exchange of molecules and production of peritoneal ﬂuid, thus providing an environment in which intra-abdominal organs can function properly. When traumatized, whether by surgery or due to inﬂammatory processes, a series of responses come into action to regenerate the injured part of the peritoneum. The inﬂammatory reaction causes inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells but also activates resident mesothelial cells, ultimately leading to a ﬁbrinous exudate. Depending on the severity of the trauma this exudate is transient due to ﬁbrinolysis, or becomes more dense as a result of ﬁbroblasts persisting, leading to ﬁbrinous adhesions. A pivotal role is taken by the enzyme plasmin and its promotors and inhibitors; it is mainly the tissue-type plasminogen activator ⁄ plasminogen activator inhibitor ratio which determines the rate of ﬁbrinolysis and therefore the rate of adhesion formation. The rate of injury determines the rate and extent of the inﬂammatory response to that injury; in its turn the inﬂammatory reaction determines the extent of adhesion formation. One should realize this when performing intra-abdominal surgery, which is in fact operating inside the peritoneal organ.},

	abstract = {The amazing climbing ability of geckos has attracted the interest of philosophers and scientists alike for centuries1,2,3. However, only in the past few years2,3 has progress been made in understanding the mechanism behind this ability, which relies on submicrometre keratin hairs covering the soles of geckos. Each hair produces a miniscule force ≈10−7 N (due to van der Waals and/or capillary interactions) but millions of hairs acting together create a formidable adhesion of ≈10 N cm−2: sufficient to keep geckos firmly on their feet, even when upside down on a glass ceiling. It is very tempting3 to create a new type of adhesive by mimicking the gecko mechanism. Here we report on a prototype of such 'gecko tape' made by microfabrication of dense arrays of flexible plastic pillars, the geometry of which is optimized to ensure their collective adhesion. Our approach shows a way to manufacture self-cleaning, re-attachable dry adhesives, although problems related to their durability and mass production are yet to be resolved.},

Synthetic hydrogel particles are an inexpensive and promising alternative. In this study we synthesized and characterized N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide (APM) hydrogel particles and investigated their use as a hemostatic material. The APM hydrogel particles were synthesized via inverse suspension polymerization with a narrow size distribution and rapid swelling behavior. In vitro coagulation studies showed hydrogel particle blood aggregate formation as well as bulk blood coagulation inhibition. In vivo studies using multiple rat injury and ovine liver laceration models demonstrated the particles’ ability to aid in rapid hemostasis. Subsequent hematoxylin and eosin and Carstairs’ method staining of the ovine liver incision sites showed significant hemostatic plug formation. This study suggests that these cationic hydrogel particles form a physical barrier to blood loss by forming aggregates, while causing a general decrease in coagulation activity in the bulk. The formation of a rapid sealant through aggregation and the promotion of local hemostasis through electrostatic interactions are coupled with a decrease in overall coagulation activity. These interactions require the interplay of a variety of mechanisms stemming from a simple synthetic platform.},

The shift in Tg resulting from the resin can be estimated using the Fox equation.

Poly(glucose-6-acrylate-1,2,3,4-tetraacetate) [PGATA] and poly(acetylated acrylic isosorbide) [PAAI] end blocks were chain-extended from a poly(n-butyl acrylate) [PnBA] midblock. PAAI−PnBA−PAAI exhibited excellent adhesion properties: peel = 8.74 N cm−1, loop tack = 2.96 N cm−2, no shear failure up to 100 h, and shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT) = 60 °C. Although similar peel adhesion and higher loop tack were observed for PGATA−PnBA−PGATA, the shear strength and SAFT were moderate (18 h and 42 °C, respectively). PAAI−PnBA−PAAI are tough elastomers and demonstrated high stress and elongation at break (σ = 6.5 MPa and ε = 620\%, respectively) while the GATA-based analogue exhibited weaker tensile properties (σ = 0.8 MPa and ε = 476\%). To address this, the anomeric hydroxyl groups of GATA units were selectively deprotected to promote self-complementary hydrogen bonding in the glassy domains, resulting in 80\% enhancement in the ultimate tensile stress at break (σ = 1.5 MPa). This study aims to demonstrate eﬀects of noncovalent interactions, such as chain entanglements and self-complementary hydrogen bonding, to enhance the adhesion and mechanical performance of sugarderived TPEs.},

A new dural sealant has to be thoroughly assessed before clinical application in in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials.

This study prepared crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan by crosslinking reaction with glutaraldehyde and determined its physicochemical properties, FT-IR spectra, and toxicity and cell morphology on L929 fibroblasts. The hemostatic effect and healing function of crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan on rat liver were also evaluated. The animals were divided into three groups (n = 18): control group (Con), Surgicel® group (Sur), and crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan group (C-CMC). The results showed that crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan with high viscosity was successfully prepared, which had no cytotoxicity and no abnormal effects on cell morphology to L929 fibroblasts of mouse, and had significantly shorter bleeding time and less blood loss compared to Con and Sur (P {\textless} 0.05). The enzyme activity analysis on 7, 14 and 21 days showed that crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan can significantly elevate the activities of inflammatory factor enzymes at earlier time and restore them to normal level faster (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) (P {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Seprafilm adhesion barrier (Seprafilm) has been proven to prevent adhesion formation after abdominal and pelvic surgery. This article reports safety results, including the postoperative incidence of abdominal and pelvic abscess and pulmonary embolism, from a large, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Seprafilm for reduction of adhesion-related postoperative bowel obstruction after abdominopelvic surgery.
METHODS: A total of 1791 patients participated in this prospective, randomized, multicenter, multinational, single-blind, controlled study in patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery, the majority of whom had inflammatory bowel disease. Just before closure of the abdomen, patients were randomized to a Seprafilm or no-treatment control group. Patients received an average of 4.4 and as many as 10 Seprafilm adhesion barriers applied to organs and tissue surfaces that sustained direct surgical trauma and to suspected adhesiogenic surfaces. Complications that occurred within the first month after surgery were evaluated.
RESULTS: During the safety evaluation period, the difference between the Seprafilm and control groups for the incidence of abscess (4 vs. 3 percent, respectively) or pulmonary embolism ({\textless}1 percent in both groups) was not statistically significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Foreign body reaction was not reported in either group. Fistula (2 vs. {\textless}1 percent) and peritonitis (2 vs. {\textless}1 percent) occurred more frequently (P {\textless}or= 0.05) in the Seprafilm group. In a subpopulation of patients in whom Seprafilm was wrapped around a fresh bowel anastomosis, leak-related events, which included anastomotic leak, fistula, peritonitis, abscess, and sepsis, occurred more frequently (P {\textless}or= 0.05). There were no other differences in the incidence, severity, or causative relationship of complications between study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the safety of Seprafilm adhesion barrier with respect to abdominal abscess, pelvic abscess, and pulmonary embolism when administered to patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery. Foreign body reaction was not reported for any patient. However, wrapping the suture or staple line of a fresh bowel anastomosis with Seprafilm should be avoided, because the data suggest that this practice may increase the risk of sequelae associated with anastomotic leak.},

	abstract = {Background: The creation of ischemic buttons from parietal peritoneal tissue using a ligature is among the most established models for adhesion induction. However this model is plagued by slipping of ligatures and subsequent obliteration of the buttons when the animals mobilize postoperatively. Here we describe an improved model that involves creating the buttons with a backstitch ligature and compare it to the traditional model. Methods: A total of 160 ischemic buttons were created in 20 adult Wistar rats. Ischemic buttons in the control group (n == 80) were created using the traditional technique whereas ischemic buttons in the investigative group (n == 80) were created using the novel technique with a backstitch ligature. The resulting adhesions and the frequency of slipped ligatures were analyzed on postoperative day 10. Results: Slipping of the ligature with obliteration of the button occurred in 18.8\%\% (n == 15/80) of buttons in the control group and in 3.8\%\% (n == 3/80) of buttons in the investigative group (p {\textless} .01). Adhesions formed to 69.2\%\% (n == 45/65) of the remaining buttons in the control group and to 62.3\%\% (n == 48/77) of the remaining buttons in the investigative group (p == .38). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in adhesion quantity between the models. However, the novel technique significantly reduced postoperative slipping of the ligatures with obliteration of buttons. As a result, a greater number of intact buttons are available for data collection. Furthermore slipped sutures, which act as foreign bodies in uncontrollable locations, no longer confound adhesion formation to the remaining buttons.},

Quality-by-design (QbD) principles were applied to gain an understanding of the ultrasonic spray coating process of DES. Statistically based design of experiments (DOE) were used to understand the relationship between ultrasonic atomization spray coating parameters and dependent variables such as coating mass ratio, roughness, drug solid state composite microstructure, and elution kinetics. Defect-free DES coatings composed of 70\% 85:15 poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) and 30\% everolimus were fabricated with a constant coating mass. The drug elution profile was characterized by a mathematical model describing biphasic release kinetics. Model coefficients were analyzed as a DOE response. Changes in ultrasonic coating processing conditions resulted in substantial changes in roughness and elution kinetics. Based on the outcome from the DOE study, a design space was defined in terms of the critical coating process parameters resulting in optimum coating roughness and drug elution. This QbD methodology can be useful to enhance the quality of coated DES.},

We have developed a novel moldable nanocomposite hydrogel by combining dopamine-modified poly(ethylene glycol) and the nanosilicate Laponite, without the use of cytotoxic oxidants. The hydrogel transitioned from a reversibly cross-linked network formed by dopamine–Laponite interfacial interactions to a covalently cross-linked network through the slow autoxidation and cross-linking of catechol moieties. Initially, the hydrogel could be remolded to different shapes, could recover from large strain deformation, and could be injected through a syringe to adhere to the convex contour of a tissue surface. With time, the hydrogel solidified to adopt the new shape and sealed defects on the tissue. This fit-to-shape sealant has potential in sealing tissues with non-flat geometries, such as a sutured anastomosis.},

	abstract = {We have formed noncovalent inclusion compounds (ICs) between guest poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) chains, with molecular weights ranging from ∼2000 to 80 000 g/mol, and host urea (U). Upon careful removal of the U host, each of the guest PCL chains were coalesced from their U-IC crystals to produce coalesced samples (c-PCLs). As previously observed for PCL and other polymer guests when coalesced from their ICs formed with host cyclodextrins (CDs), upon cooling from their melts, PCLs coalesced from their U-ICs also show enhanced abilities to crystallize, regardless of their molecular weight. Also consistent with polymer guests, including PCL, that were coalesced from their CD-ICs, c-PCLs obtained from their U-ICs retain their enhanced abilities to crystallize even after spending long times (weeks or more) in the melt. Because, unlike CD hosts, U does not thread over guest polymer chains in their ICs, we conclude that the enhanced ability of c-PCLs to crystallize from their melts upon removal of either host from their ICs is solely a consequence of their coalesced conformations/structures/morphologies, which are stable to prolonged melt-annealing. Furthermore, because c-PCLs with chain lengths well below and well above those corresponding to the entanglement molecular weight of PCL behave similarly, we conclude that their enhanced ability to crystallize from the melt is likely an exclusive consequence of the extended and unentangled arrangement of their coalesced chains. In addition, c-PCLs obtained from their U-ICs are observed to effectively act as self-nucleants, when added in small amounts to as-received PCLs, to produce nuc-PCLs, which like neat c-PCLs exhibit an enhanced ability to melt-crystallize.},

We hypothesized that the use of a functionalized biocompatible polymer for a stent coating could be appropriate for local arterial therapy. A cationized pullulan hydrogel was thus prepared to cover bare metal stents that could be further loaded with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted at MMP2 for gene silencing in vascular cells. The efficient coverage of the stent struts by a smooth polymeric layer, which can withstand the crimping of the stent on a balloon-catheter and its deployment, was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The release of siRNA from the stents was modulated by the presence of the cationic groups, as compared to noncationized pullulan hydrogel. In vivo implantation of coated stents was successful and cationized pullulan-based hydrogels loaded with siRNA in rabbit balloon-injured carotid arteries induced an uptake of siRNA into the arterial wall and a decrease of pro-MMP2 activity. These results suggest that cationized pullulan-based hydrogel could be used as a new biocompatible and biodegradable stent coating for local gene therapy in the arterial wall.},

	abstract = {One procedure to treat stenotic coronary arteries is the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In recent years, drug-eluting stents (DESs) have demonstrated elaborate ways to improve outcomes of intravascular interventions. To enhance DESs, the idea has evolved to design stents that elute specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for better vascular wall regeneration. Layer-by-layer (LbL) technology offers the possibility of incorporating siRNA nanoplexes (NPs) to achieve bioactive medical implant coatings. The LbL technique was used to achieve hyaluronic acid/chitosan (HA/Chi) films with incorporated Chi-siRNA NPs. The multilayer growth was monitored by quartz crystal microbalance. The coating on the stents and its thickness were analyzed using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. All stents showed a homogeneous coating, and the polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) were not disrupted after ethylene oxide sterilization or expansion. The in vitro uptake of fluorescent-labeled NPs from PEMs in primary human endothelial cells (ECs) was analyzed by flow cytometry for 2, 6 and 9days. Furthermore, stents coated with HA/Chi and Chi-siRNA NPs were expanded into porcine arteries and showed ex vivo delivery of NPs. The films showed no critical results in terms of hemocompatibility. This study demonstrates that Chi-siRNA NPs can be incorporated into PEMs consisting of HA and Chi. We conclude that the NPs were delivered to ECs under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, under ex vivo conditions, NPs were transferred into porcine artery walls. Due to their good hemocompatibility, they might make an innovative tool for achieving bioactive coatings for coronary stents.},

	abstract = {Restenosis is the formation of blockages occurring at the site of angioplasty or stent placement. In order to avoid such blockages, the suppression of smooth muscle cells near the implanted stent is required. The Akt1 protein is known to be responsible for cellular proliferation, and specific inhibition of Akt1 gene expression results in the retardation of cell growth. To take advantage of these benefits, we developed a new delivery technique for Akt1 siRNA nanoparticles from a hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated stent surface. For this purpose, the disulfide cross-linked low molecular polyethyleneimine (PEI) (ssPEI) was used as a gene delivery carrier because disulfide bonds are stable in an oxidative extracellular environment but degrade rapidly in reductive intracellular environments. In this study, Akt1 siRNA showed efficient ionic interaction with the ssPEI carrier, which was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Akt1 siRNA/ssPEI nanoparticles (ASNs) were immobilized on the HA-coated stent surface and exhibited stable binding and localization, followed by time-dependent sustained release for intracellular uptake. Cellular viability on the nanoparticle-immobilized surface was assessed using A10 vascular smooth muscle cells, and the results revealed that immobilized ASNs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity against the adhering A10 cells. Transfection efficiency was quantified using a luciferase assay; the transgene expression of Akt1 suppression through the delivered Akt1 siRNA was measured using RT-PCR and western blot, demonstrating higher gene silencing efficiency when compared to other carriers. ASN coated on HA stents were deployed in the balloon-injured external iliac artery in rabbits in vivo. It was shown that the Akt1 released from the stent suppressed the growth of the smooth muscle at the peri-stent implantation area, resulting in the prevention of restenosis in the post-implantation phase.},

	abstract = {One of the most common medical interventions to reopen an occluded vessel is the implantation of a coronary stent. While this method of treatment is effective initially, restenosis, or the re-narrowing of the artery frequently occurs largely due to neointimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells. Drug eluting stents were developed in order to provide local, site-specific, controlled release of drugs that can inhibit neointima formation. By implementing a controlled release delivery system it may be possible to control the time release of the pharmacological factors and thus be able to bypass some of the critical events associated with stent hyperplasia and prevent the need for subsequent intervention. However, since the advent of first-generation drug eluting stents, long-term adverse effects have raised concerns regarding their safety. These limitations in safety and efficacy have triggered considerable research in developing biodegradable stents and more potent drug delivery systems. In this review, we shed light on the current state-of-the-art in drug eluting stents, problems related to them and highlight some of the ongoing research in this area.},

Many of the models presented in this paper have evolved from drug transport models in other applications.

Data for the two most important drugs, sirolimus (rapamycin) and paclitaxel, are presented, the polymers used are described and the observed release profiles are discussed for various polymer carriers. The current literature on the tissue compatibility of the polymers commonly used in drug-eluting stents is also discussed. The range of release rates from stents studied to date is limited for sirolimus, but somewhat broader for paclitaxel. Animal and human data comparing the different release profiles are limited to about 6 months for animals and 2–4 years for humans. From the data available, it appears that for both sirolimus and paclitaxel, a slow-releasing drug-eluting stent leads to slightly more favorable angiographic outcomes than more rapid release. Most of the complications arising from the use of drug-eluting stents are attributed to incomplete healing; one possible clinical consequence of this delay in healing is that anti-platelet therapy needs to be maintained over a much longer period than is the case for bare metal stents.},

In that time, 15 patients died, 20 withdrew consent, and 10 were lost to follow-up, leaving 161 (78.2\%) patients for 36-month assessment.ResultsThe 12-month freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) was 87.3\% for the stent group vs. 45.2\% for the angioplasty group (p{\textless}0.0001). At 3 years, there was no difference in survival (90.0\% vs. 91.7\%, p=0.71) or major adverse events (75.2\% vs. 75.2\%, p=0.98) between the stent and angioplasty groups. Duplex ultrasound was not mandated after the first year, so stent patency could not be ascertained beyond 1 year, but freedom from TLR at 3 years was significantly better in the stent group (75.5\% vs. 41.8\%, p{\textless}0.0001), as was clinical success (63.2\% vs. 17.9\%, p{\textless}0.0001). At 18 months, a 4.1\% (12/291) stent fracture rate was documented.ConclusionIn this multicenter trial, primary implantation of a nitinol stent for moderate-length lesions in the femoropopliteal segment of patients with claudication was associated with better long-term results vs. balloon angioplasty alone.},

We report the fabrication of ultrathin, multilayered polyelectrolyte films that permit both the immobilization and controlled release of plasmid DNA from the surfaces of stainless steel intravascular stents. Our approach makes use of an aqueous-based, layer-by-layer method for the assembly of nanostructured thin films consisting of alternating layers of plasmid DNA and a hydrolytically degradable polyamine. Characterization of coated stents using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that stents were coated uniformly with an ultrathin film ca. 120 nm thick that adhered conformally to the surfaces of stent struts. These ultrathin films did not crack, peel, or delaminate substantially from the surface after exposure to a range of mechanical challenges representative of those encountered during stent deployment (e.g., balloon expansion). Stents coated with eight bilayers of degradable polyamine and a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sustained the release of DNA into solution for up to four days when incubated in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C, and coated stents were capable of mediating the expression of EGFP in a mammalian cell line without the aid of additional transfection agents.

Ionically cross-linked multilayers ∼120 nm thick were fabricated layer-by-layer on the surfaces of balloon-mounted stainless steel stents using plasmid DNA and a hydrolytically degradable poly(β-amino ester) (polymer 1). Characterization of stents coated using a fluorescently end-labeled analog of polymer 1 revealed film erosion to be uniform across the surfaces of the stents; differential stresses experienced upon balloon expansion did not lead to faster film erosion or dose dumping of DNA in areas near stent joints when stents were incubated in physiologically relevant media. The ability of film-coated stents to transfer DNA and transfect arterial tissue in vivo was then investigated in pigs and rabbits. Stents coated with films fabricated using fluorescently labeled DNA resulted in uniform transfer of DNA to sub-endothelial tissue in the arteries of pigs in patterns corresponding to the locations and geometries of stent struts. Stents coated with films fabricated using polymer 1 and plasmid DNA encoding EGFP resulted in expression of EGFP in the medial layers of stented tissue in both pigs and rabbits two days after implantation. The results of this study, combined with the modular and versatile nature of layer-by-layer assembly, provide a polymer-based platform that is well suited for fundamental studies of stent-mediated gene transfer. With further development, this approach could also prove useful for the design of nonviral, gene-based approaches for prevention of complications that arise from the implantation of stents and other implantable interventional devices.},

Here, we report multilayered polyelectrolyte assemblies that sustain the release of functional plasmid DNA from the surfaces of model substrates under physiological conditions. Multilayered assemblies consisting of alternating layers of plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a synthetic degradable polyamine were deposited on planar silicon and quartz substrates using a layer-by-layer fabrication process. Film growth was monitored by ellipsometry and UV spectrophotometry and correlated linearly with the number of polymer and plasmid layers deposited. In general, the thickness of deposited layers was found to be a function of both the pH and the ionic strength of the polyelectrolyte solutions used. Films up to 100 nm thick were investigated in this study. These assemblies erode gradually upon incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, as determined by ellipsometry and UV spectrophotometry, and sustain the release of incorporated plasmid into the incubation medium for a period of up to 30 h. Characterization of the released plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the DNA was released in a relaxed, open circular, rather than supercoiled, topology; subsequent cell transfection experiments demonstrated that the released plasmid is transcriptionally viable and promotes the expression of EGFP in the COS-7 cell line. These layered materials could represent an approach to the controlled administration of one or more functional DNA constructs from the surfaces of biomedical materials and devices.},

	abstract = {We report an approach to the design of degradable polyelectrolyte-based films for the controlled release of siRNA from surfaces. Our approach is based on stepwise, layer-by-layer assembly of multilayered polyelectrolyte films (or “polyelectrolyte multilayers”, PEMs) using siRNA and a hydrolytically degradable poly(β-amino ester) (polymer 1). Fabrication of films using siRNA sequences for green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase resulted in linear growth of ultrathin films (∼50 nm thick) that promoted the surface-mediated release of siRNA upon incubation in physiologically relevant media. Physicochemical characterization of these siRNA-containing films revealed large differences in film growth profiles, physical erosion profiles, and siRNA release profiles as compared to PEMs fabricated using polymer 1 and larger plasmid DNA constructs. For example, whereas films fabricated using plasmid DNA erode gradually and release DNA over a period of ∼48 h, films fabricated using siRNA released ∼65\% of incorporated siRNA within the first hour of incubation, prior to the onset of any observed film erosion. This initial burst of release was followed by a second, slower phase of release (accompanied by gradual film erosion) over the next 23 h. These differences in release profiles and other behaviors likely result, at least in part, from large differences in the sizes of siRNA and plasmid DNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the siRNA in these films is released in a form that remains intact, functional, and able to silence targeted protein expression upon administration to mammalian cells in vitro. The results of this investigation provide a platform for the design of thin films and coatings that could be used to localize the release of siRNA from surfaces in a variety of fundamental and applied contexts (e.g., for development of new research tools or approaches to delivery from film-coated implants and other devices).},

	abstract = {The degradation behavior of the absorbable coating may have significant impacts to the short and long-term safety of the drug eluting stent (DES). A poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer coating containing sirolimus on stent surface was studied when stents were expanded to 3.0 mm. In vitro and in vivo degradation behavior of coated stents and cast films were characterized by light microscope, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), weight loss, field-emission environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM-FEG) and SEM combined with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). For in vivo study, specially designed chambers with semi-permeable membrane were used to host the stents during the implantation. The data indicated the coating polymer lost 80\% molecular weight and 60\% of its mass in 60 days. The complete degradation of the coating occurred in 6 months. The degradation of the coating seemed to be homogeneous, and the coating went through a hydration/swelling process before it became completely degraded. It was noted that the coating maintained its integrity and strong adhesion to the strut during the entire degradation process, no fragmentation delaminate were observed. The study also demonstrated similar degradation behaviors of the drug coating in in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

Moreover, many targets have proven to be intractable to traditional small-molecule and protein approaches. Therapeutics based on RNA interference (RNAi) offer a powerful method for rapidly identifying specific and potent inhibitors of disease targets from all molecular classes. Numerous proof-of-concept studies in animal models of human disease demonstrate the broad potential application of RNAi therapeutics. The major challenge for successful drug development is identifying delivery strategies that can be translated to the clinic. With advances in this area and the commencement of multiple clinical trials with RNAi therapeutic candidates, a transformation in modern medicine may soon be realized.},

Approximately 18h. following gene transfer the subject was noted to have altered mental status and jaundice—clinical signs not seen in any of the first 17 subjects in this study. Subsequently, his clinical course was marked by systemic inflammatory response syndrome, biochemically detectable disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ system failure, leading to death 98h following gene transfer. Post-mortem examination was consistent with the clinical course, and vector DNA sequences were readily detectable in most tissues. The subject had high serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 but normal TNFα immediately after infusion of the vector.

	abstract = {Background:
The aim of the current study was twofold: To investigate the effect of veteran status on risk of developing heart disease over a period of 20 years in the United States and to test if socio-economic characteristics, chronic conditions, health behaviors, body mass index (BMI) and depressive symptoms explain the association between veteran status and risk of heart disease.

Methods:
Data came from the Health and Retirement Study, a 20 year national cohort from 1992 to 2012. The study enrolled a representative sample of Americans over the age of 50. We included 8,375 individuals who were older than 50 years at entry, did not have heart disease at baseline and provided data on heart disease over the next 20 years. Veteran status was considered to be the independent variable. Self-reported data on physician diagnosis of heart disease, which was measured on a biannual basis, was the outcome. Baseline socio-economic data (i.e. age, gender, race, marital status and education), chronic conditions (diabetes and hypertension), health behaviors (i.e. drinking, smoking, and exercise), BMI and depressive symptoms (modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) were entered into logistic regressions. Logistic regression was used for data analysis.

Results:
Veterans were at higher risk of having a new onset of heart disease (unadjusted relative risk [RR] = 1.996, 95\% confidence interval [CI] =1.694-2.351), compared with non-veterans. Logistic regression confirmed the association between veteran status and heart disease (adjusted RR = 1.483, 95\% CI = 1.176-1.871) after controlling for all covariates.

Conclusions:
Veterans may be at higher risk for heart disease over time and this link may be independent of baseline socio-economic characteristics, chronic medical conditions, health behaviors, BMI and depressive symptoms. Veterans may require more rigorous cardiovascular prevention programs.},

The prevalence of these conditions among women veterans is incompletely described.OBJECTIVETo describe the prevalence of CVD risk factors among women veterans in middle adulthood.DESIGNSerial cross-sectional studies of data from the Diabetes Epidemiologic Cohorts (DEpiC), a national, longitudinal data set including information on all patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VA).PARTICIPANTSWomen veterans (n = 255,891) and men veterans (n = 2,271,605) aged 35–64 receiving VA care in fiscal year (FY) 2010.MAIN MEASURESPrevalence of CVD risk factors in FY2010 by age and, for those aged 45–54 years, by race, region, period of military service, priority status, and mental illness or substance abuse; prevalence by year from 2000 to 2010 in women veterans receiving VA care in both 2000 and 2010 who were free of the factor in 2000.KEY RESULTSHypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes were common among women and men, although more so among men. Hypertension was present in 13 \% of women aged 35–44 years, 28 \% of women aged 45–54, and 42 \% of women aged 55–64. Hyperlipidemia prevalence was similar. Diabetes affected 4 \% of women aged 35–44, and increased more than four-fold in prevalence to 18 \% by age 55–64. The prevalence of obesity increased from 14 \% to 18 \% with age among women and was similarly prevalent in men. The relative rate of having two or more CVD risk factors in women compared to men increased progressively with age, from 0.55 (35–44 years) to 0.71 (45–54) to 0.73 (55–64). Most of the women with a factor present in 2010 were first diagnosed with the condition in the 10 years between 2000 and 2010.CONCLUSIONSCVD risk factors are common among women veterans aged 35–64. Future research should investigate which interventions would most effectively reduce risk in this population.},

Polymerization proceeded exclusively via the conjugate addition of the secondary amines to the bis(acrylate ester). Polymers were isolated in up to 86\% yields with molecular weights ranging up to 31 200 relative to polystyrene standards. The polymers degraded hydrolytically in acidic and alkaline media to yield 1,4-butanediol and β-amino acids 4a−6a and the degradation kinetics were investigated at pH 5.1 and 7.4. In general, the polymers degraded more rapidly at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.1. In initial screening assays, both the polymers and their degradation products were determined to be noncytotoxic relative to poly(ethylene imine), a polymer conventionally employed as a synthetic transfection vector. Polymers 1−3 interacted electrostatically with polyanionic plasmid DNA in water and buffer at physiological pH, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, quasi-elastic dynamic light scattering (QELS), and ζ-potential measurements. All three polymers condensed DNA into soluble DNA/polymer particles on the order of 50−200 nm. Particles formed from polymers 1 and 2 aggregated extensively, while particles formed from polymer 3 exhibited positive ζ-potentials (e.g., +10 to +15 mV) and did not aggregate for up to 18 h. The nanometer-sized dimensions and reduced cytotoxicities of these DNA/polymer complexes suggest that these types of polymers may be useful as degradable polymeric gene transfer vectors.},

	abstract = {Background
Endothelial gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection represents a promising strategy for the control of vascular disease. Here, we demonstrate endothelial gene silencing in human saphenous vein using three rapid siRNA transfection techniques amenable for use in the operating room.
Methods
Control siRNA, Cy5 siRNA, or siRNA targeting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or endothelial specific nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were applied to surplus human saphenous vein for 10 minutes by (i) soaking, (ii) applying 300 mm Hg hyperbaric pressure, or (iii) 120 mm Hg luminal distending pressure. Transfected vein segments were maintained in organ culture. siRNA delivery and gene silencing were assessed by tissue layer using confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
Results
Distending pressure transfection yielded the highest levels of endothelial siRNA delivery (22\% pixels fluorescing) and gene silencing (60\% GAPDH knockdown, 55\% eNOS knockdown) as compared with hyperbaric (12\% pixels fluorescing, 36\% GAPDH knockdown, 30\% eNOS knockdown) or non-pressurized transfections (10\% pixels fluorescing, 30\% GAPDH knockdown, 25\% eNOS knockdown). Cumulative endothelial siRNA delivery (16\% pixels fluorescing) and gene silencing (46\% GAPDH knockdown) exceeded levels achieved in the media/adventitia (8\% pixels fluorescing, 24\% GAPDH knockdown) across all transfection methods.
Conclusion
Endothelial gene silencing is possible within the time frame and conditions of surgical application without the use of transfection reagents. The high sensitivity of endothelial cells to siRNA transfection marks the endothelium as a promising target of gene therapy in vascular disease.},

	abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is the underlying cause of most cardiovascular disease. Both cells of the vessel wall and cells of the immune system participate in atherogenesis. This process is heavily influenced by plasma lipoproteins, genetics, and the hemodynamics of the blood flow in the artery. A variety of small and large animal models have been used to study the atherogenic process. No model is ideal as each has its own advantages and limitations with respect to manipulation of the atherogenic process and modeling human atherosclerosis or lipoprotein profile. Useful large animal models include pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates. Due in large part to the relative ease of genetic manipulation and the relatively short time frame for the development of atherosclerosis, murine models are currently the most extensively used. Although not all aspects of murine atherosclerosis are identical to humans, studies using murine models have suggested potential biological processes and interactions that underlie this process. As it becomes clear that different factors may influence different stages of lesion development, the use of mouse models with the ability to turn on or delete proteins or cells in tissue specific and temporal manner will be very valuable.},

In regions where increased haemodynamic strain was anticipated, similar structural changes were observed in normal and hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. However, changes indicating cell injury were more wide-spread in cholesterolfed animals. This suggests that hypercholesterolaemia may increase cell susceptibility to injury. In the same regions, the development of intimal thickenings was observed in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The central parts of such thickenings had been reendothelialized, whereas a region with cell injury surrounded each lesion. In regions with low haemodynamic strain, a loss of fine-structural details was observed in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. It is suggested that these changes may be related to the deteriorated functional properties of the intact endothelium in such rabbits. In view of these data it is suggested that the interrelationship between hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerotic arterial disease may partly be due to a deleterious effect of hypercholesterolaemia on the functional and structural integrity of the arterial endothelium.},

Here we show that Lagomorpha is significantly more closely related to Primates and Scandentia (tree shrews) than it is to rodents. This newly determined phylogenetic position invalidates the superordinal taxon Glires (Lagomorpha + Rodentia), and indicates that the morphological 'synapomorphies' previously used to cluster rodents and lagomorphs into Glires2,3, may actually represent symplesiomorphies or homoplasies that are of no phylogenetic value. This raises the possibility that the ancestral eutherian morphotype may have possessed many rodent-like morphological characters.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose We tested the hypothesis that vasospastic arteries do not reconstrict after angioplasty because angioplasty decreases smooth muscle contractility.Methods Twenty-four rabbits had carotid angiography and placement of silicone elastomer sheaths around both carotid arteries in the neck. Sheaths were empty (control groups) or filled with clotted blood (vasospasm groups). Angiography was repeated 2 days later, and one carotid artery was dilated with a balloon catheter. Animals were killed 1, 5, or 28 days after angioplasty, and the carotid arteries were studied pharmacologically under isometric tension.Results Before angioplasty, there was significant vasospasm in the vasospasm groups but not in the control groups (P{\textless}.05, ANOVA). Angioplasty produced significant, long-lasting dilation of arteries in the vasospasm groups. One and 5 days after angioplasty, arteries from control and vasospasm groups that had angioplasty had significantly reduced contractions to serotonin, KCl, and caffeine compared with arteries not subjected to angioplasty. Twenty-eight days after angioplasty, contractions were reduced in arteries subjected to vasospasm compared with controls, but there were no differences between arteries with or without angioplasty. At all times after angioplasty, vasospasm significantly decreased acetylcholine-induced relaxations of arteries contracted with serotonin. Relaxations were further decreased by angioplasty in the vasospasm group 1 day after angioplasty. Arterial wall compliance was significantly decreased in the vasospasm and control groups at all times after angioplasty, although there were no significant differences between arteries with and without angioplasty.Conclusions These results suggest that arteries do not reconstrict after angioplasty because angioplasty decreases smooth muscle contractility. There was no evidence that angioplasty disrupted the arterial wall matrix, as judged by the lack of increase in arterial wall compliance after angioplasty.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Endovascular treatments such as balloon angioplasty and injection of vasodilators play an important role in cerebral vasospasm refractory to first-line therapies. Experimental studies with intracranial arteries of animals have some limitations, however, because in most cases endovascular devices are too large and inflexible to catheterize these arteries. The purpose of this study was to document the natural course of a vasospasm model using a rabbit common carotid artery.
Materials and Methods
The common carotid arteries of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were used. Autologous blood was placed around the isolated artery and kept in place with a silicone cuff. The time course of vasoconstriction after blood clot placement was examined with angiography and with histopathologic evaluation.
Results
Angiographic vasoconstriction was prominent on day 2, less obvious on day 9, and absent on day 30. At histopathologic evaluation, folding of the endothelial surface, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina, and thickening of the arterial wall were observed in the group with blood clot placements around the artery on day 2 and were nearly absent on day 30.
Conclusion
This model may be used for the study of endovascular treatments of vasospasm.},

	abstract = {Animal models of atherosclerosis often present limitations of transferability, since important hallmarks of human disease are not completely reproduced in other species. Rabbits have been used in several approaches: 1) inbred strains: Watanabe hereditary hyperlipidemic animals which express a defect in the LDL receptor, 2) transgenic rabbits, which overexpress human lipoproteins, and first knock-out rabbits. 3) native New Zealand white rabbits (NZW) fed with cholesterol-rich diet for at least 8 weeks represent the quickest way to establish arteriosclerosis. Rabbits are arguably the most sensitive animal species to cholesterol overload. Interventions in native or arteriosclerotic arteries are used to induce local thrombus formation, e.g. endothelial denudation or photochemical injury. In contrast to smaller animals, catheterisation of coronary arteries is feasible, whose external ligation serves to induce myocardial infarction. As biological endpoints, arterial vasoreactivity/endothelial dysfunction can be studied in analogy to measurements of brachial artery vasomotion in humans in response to increasing doses of acetylcholine or volume challenges. Tissue fixation allows studying vascular morphology, plaque sizes and thrombi after local interventions. Macrophage and T lymphocyte invasion can be investigated histologically. Positron emission tomography (PET/MRI) offers to measure plaques and content in vivo serially in the same animals. Local virally mediated gene transfer to atherosclerotic rabbit arteries has been established as a rapid and reproducible method to test interesting transgenes. Histological plaque features correspond well to alterations in patients (inflammation and lipid load). Thus, effects of any proteins can be studied directly in the arteriosclerotic disease background – much quicker than after germline transgenesis and cross-breeding.},

The administration of different types of diets can cause different types of lesions.

	abstract = {Percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. However, neither bare-metal stents nor polymer-coated drug-eluting stents represent ideal therapies at this time due to the undesired in-stent stenosis or delayed thrombosis. Hence there is pressing clinical need for greater understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved. It is hoped that this in turn will provide insight into designing and developing the next generation of stents. Although immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence are appropriate tools in understanding the molecular histology, performing these techniques on stented blood vessels is technically challenging because of poor permeability of antibodies into the stented blood vessels which are embedded in methacrylate-based resins and inadequate image resolution due to autofluorescence. Hence there is a need to develop techniques which can facilitate immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence procedures on stented blood vessel cross-sections. In this study we describe an improved protocol for processing stented porcine coronary arteries for immunostaining with smooth muscle cell, endothelial cell, monocyte and macrophage markers. We first identified the optimal conditions for resin embedding of stented artery and cross sectioned the vessels using high speed precision wafering diamond blade. The sections were then ground using two levels of water sandpaper on a Metaserve 2000 grinder to achieve the desired thickness. For immunostaining, we developed a novel deplasticization protocol which favors optimal antibody permeabilization. Our protocol not only provides feasibility of improved immunostaining of stented artery sections but also results in high quality images.},

	abstract = {Background Study of the vascular response to stent implantation has been hampered by difficulties in sectioning metal and tissue without distortion of the tissue stent interface. The metal is often removed before histochemical processing, causing a loss of arterial architecture. Histological and immunohistochemical sections should be 5 μm with an intact tissue stent interface.
Objectives To identify the most suitable cutting and grinding equipment, embedding resin, and slides for producing thin sections of stented arteries with the stent wires in situ for histological, immunohistochemical, and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses.
Methods 20 balloon stainless steel stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of 10 pigs. Twenty eight days later the stented arterial segments were excised, formalin fixed, embedded in five different resins (Epon 812, LR white, T9100, T8100, and JB4), and sectioned with two different high speed saws and a grinder for histological, immunohistochemical, and TEM analyses. Five stented human arteries were obtained at necropsy and processed using the best of the reported methods.
Results The Isomet precision saw and grinder/polisher unit reliably produced 5 μm sections with most embedding resins; minimum section thickness with the horizontal saw was 400 μm. Resin T8100, a glycol methacrylate, enabled satisfactory sectioning, grinding, and histological (toluidine blue, haematoxylin and eosin, and trichromatic and polychromatic stains) and immunohistochemical analyses (α smooth muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, vimentin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and CD68 (mac 387)). T9100 and T8100 embedded stented sections were suitable for ultrastructural examination with TEM. Stented human arterial sections showed preserved arterial architecture with the struts in situ.
Conclusion This study identified the optimal methods for embedding, sawing, grinding, and slide mounting of stented arteries to achieve 5 μm sections with an intact tissue metal interface, excellent surface qualities, histological and immunohistochemical staining properties, and suitability for TEM examination. The technique is applicable to experimental and clinical specimens.},

	abstract = {The histological study of arteries with implanted metallic scaffolding devices, known as stents, remains a technical challenge. Given that the arterial response to stent implantation can sometimes lead to adverse outcomes, including the re-accumulation of tissue mass within the stent (or in-stent restenosis), overcoming these technical challenges is a priority for the advancement of research and development in this important clinical field. Essentially, the task is to section the stent-tissue interface with the least amount of disruption of tissue and cellular morphology. Although many methacrylate resin methodologies are successfully applied toward the study of endovascular stents by a variety of research laboratories, the exact formulations, as well as subsequent processing and sectioning methodology, remain largely coveted. In this paper, we describe in detail a methyl methacrylate resinembedding methodology that can successfully be applied to tungsten carbide blade, as well as saw and grinding sectioning methods and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, we present a comparison of the two sectioning methodologies in terms of their effectiveness with regard to morphological, histochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses.

In this paper, we describe the application of alamarBlue, a new and versatile metabolic dye, for the detection of Swiss 3T3 fibroblast proliferation and/or survival. As a redox indicator, alamarBlue is reduced by reactions innate to cellular metabolism and, therefore, provides an indirect measure of viable cell number. Various assay parameters were optimized for a 96-well format to achieve a detectable range of fibroblast cell number from 100 to 20 000 cells/well, which is similar to that obtained with traditional (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and [3H]thymidine assay techniques. Standard (reference) curves generated with a known fibroblast stimulator were used to facilitate quantitation and comparison of unknown test substances. The alamarBlue assay offers the advantages of technical simplicity, freedom from radioisotopes, versatility in detection, no extraction, and excellent reproducibility and sensitivity. We anticipate that this simple and versatile alamarBlue assay, when used alone or in conjunction with other bioassays, will be a useful tool for investigating the complex mechanisms of cellular proliferation.},

	abstract = {Gene silencing using small interfering RNA (siRNA) has several potential therapeutic applications. In the present study, we investigated nanoparticles formulated using the biodegradable polymer, poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) for siRNA delivery. A cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI), was incorporated in the PLGA matrix to improve siRNA encapsulation in PLGA nanoparticles. PLGA-PEI nanoparticles were formulated using double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique and characterized for siRNA encapsulation and in vitro release. The effectiveness of siRNA-loaded PLGA-PEI nanoparticles in silencing a model gene, fire-fly luciferase, was investigated in cell culture. Presence of PEI in PLGA nanoparticle matrix increased siRNA encapsulation by about 2-fold and also improved the siRNA release profile. PLGA-PEI nanoparticles carrying luciferase-targeted siRNA enabled effective silencing of the gene in cells stably expressing luciferase as well as in cells that could be induced to overexpress the gene. Quantitative studies indicated that presence of PEI in PLGA nanoparticles resulted in 2-fold higher cellular uptake of nanoparticles while fluorescence microscopy studies showed that PLGA-PEI nanoparticles delivered the encapsulated siRNA in the cellular cytoplasm; both higher uptake and greater cytosolic delivery could have contributed to the gene silencing effectiveness of PLGA-PEI nanoparticles. Serum stability and lack of cytotoxicity further add to the potential of PLGA-PEI nanoparticles in gene silencing-based therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {Nucleic acid-based drugs offer a potentially effective tool for treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and infectious diseases. However, clinical applications are hindered by instability of RNA molecules in the circulation and lack of efficient vectors that can deliver RNAs to target tissues and into diseased target cells. Synthetic polymer and lipids as well as virus-based vectors are among the most widely explored vehicles for RNA delivery, but clinical progress has been limited as a result of issues related to toxicity, immunogenicity and low efficiency. Most recently, the discovery that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous RNA carriers, which may display better biocompatibility and higher delivery efficiency as compared with the synthetic systems, has provided a ray of hope in coping with the delivery dilemma, and EV-based gene therapy has already sparked general interest both in academia and industry. In this review, the current knowledge on EV biology and their role in cell–cell communication will be summarized. Promises of EVs as drug carriers and recent technologies on tailoring EVs’ biological attributes will be included, and preclinical studies in which EVs have shown promise for therapeutic RNA delivery will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Vein graft failure occurs between 1 and 6 months after implantation due to obstructive intimal hyperplasia, related in part to implantation injury. The cell-specific and temporal response of the transcriptome to vein graft implantation injury was determined by transcriptional profiling of laser capture microdissected endothelial cells (EC) and medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) from canine vein grafts, 2 hours (H) to 30 days (D) following surgery. Our results demonstrate a robust genomic response beginning at 2 H, peaking at 12–24 H, declining by 7 D, and resolving by 30 D. Gene ontology and pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes indicated that implantation injury affects inflammatory and immune responses, apoptosis, mitosis, and extracellular matrix reorganization in both cell types. Through backpropagation an integrated network was built, starting with genes differentially expressed at 30 D, followed by adding upstream interactive genes from each prior time-point. This identified significant enrichment of IL-6, IL-8, NF-κB, dendritic cell maturation, glucocorticoid receptor, and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells (TREM-1) signaling, as well as PPARα activation pathways in graft EC and SMC. Interactive network-based analyses identified IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α, and Insulin Receptor (INSR) as focus hub genes within these pathways. Real-time PCR was used for the validation of two of these genes: IL-6 and IL-8, in addition to Collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), a cornerstone of the backpropagation. In conclusion, these results establish causality relationships clarifying the pathogenesis of vein graft implantation injury, and identifying novel targets for its prevention.},

Those available are reproducible, providing only a few layers of proliferating cells or have the disadvantage of the presence of a metallic stent that complicates histology evaluation. This study was designed to develop a new, simple model of accelerated IH based on balloon injury in conjunction with disruption of the Internal Elastic Lamina (IEL) in pig external iliac arteries. Iliac artery injury (n = 24) was performed in 12 Yorkshire pigs divided in two groups: Group I (n = 10), overdistention injury induced by an oversized non-compliant balloon; Group II (n = 14), arterial wall disruption by pulling back an isometric cutting balloon (CB) followed by stretching with a compliant Fogarty Balloon (FB). At two weeks, arteries were processed for morphometric analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for smooth muscle cells (SMC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). When comparing the two groups, at 2 weeks, arteries of group II had a higher incidence of IH (100\%vs. 50\%, P = 0.0059), increased intimal areas (2.54 ± 0.33 mm2vs. 0.93 ± 0.36 mm2, P = 0.004), increased intimal area/Media area ratios (0.95 ± 0.1 vs. 0.28 ± 0.05; P {\textless} 0.0001) and decreased lumen areas (6.24 ± 0.44 vs. 9.48 ± 1.56, P = 0.026). No thrombosis was noticed in Group II. Neointima was composed by proliferating SMC located with the highest concentration in the area of IEL disruption (IHC). Arterial injury by pulling back CB and FB induces significant IH in pig iliac arteries by two weeks without thrombosis. This model is superior to the classical overdistention non-compliant model and should be useful and cost-effective for preclinical testing of procedures designed to inhibit IH in large peripheral arteries.},

	abstract = {Objective
The PREVENT III study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase III trial of a novel molecular therapy (edifoligide; E2F decoy) for the prevention of vein graft failure in patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI).
Methods
From November 2001 through October 2003, 1404 patients with CLI were randomized to a single intraoperative ex vivo vein graft treatment with edifoligide or placebo. After surgery, patients underwent graft surveillance by duplex ultrasonography and were followed up for index graft and limb end points to 1 year. A blinded Clinical Events Classification committee reviewed all index graft end points. The primary study end point was the time to nontechnical index graft reintervention or major amputation due to index graft failure. Secondary end points included all-cause graft failure, clinically significant graft stenosis ({\textgreater}70\% by angiography or severe stenosis by ultrasonography), amputation/reintervention-free survival, and nontechnical primary graft patency. Event rates were based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Time-to-event end points were compared by using the log-rank test.
Results
Demographics, comorbidities, and procedural details reflected a population with CLI and diffuse atherosclerosis. Tissue loss was the presenting symptom in 75\% of patients. High-risk conduits were used in 24\% of cases, including an alternative vein in 20\% (15\% spliced vein and 5\% non–great saphenous vein) and 6\% less than 3 mm in diameter; 14\% of the cases were reoperative bypass grafts. Most (65\%) grafts were placed to infrapopliteal targets. Perioperative (30-day) mortality occurred in 2.7\% of patients. Major morbidity included myocardial infarction in 4.7\% and early graft occlusion in 5.2\% of patients. Ex vivo treatment with edifoligide was well tolerated. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the primary or secondary trial end points, primary graft patency, or limb salvage. A statistically significant improvement was observed in secondary graft patency (estimated Kaplan-Meier rates were 83\% edifoligide and 78\% placebo; P = .016) within 1 year. The reduction in secondary patency events was manifest within 30 days of surgery (the relative risk for a 30-day event for edifoligide was 0.45; 95\% confidence interval, 0.27-0.76; P = .005). For the overall cohort at 1 year, the estimated Kaplan-Meier rate for survival was 84\%, that for primary patency was 61\%, that for primary assisted patency was 77\%, that for secondary patency was 80\%, and that for limb salvage was 88\%.
Conclusions
In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, ex vivo treatment of lower extremity vein grafts with edifoligide did not confer protection from reintervention for graft failure.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
To investigate further the safety and efficacy of the sirolimus-eluting S.M.A.R.T. Nitinol Self-expanding Stent by comparison with a bare stent in superficial femoral artery (SFA) obstructions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This randomized, double-blind study involved 57 patients (29 in the sirolimuseluting stent group and 28 in the bare stent group) with chronic limb ischemia and SFA occlusions (66.7\%) or stenoses (average lesion length, 81.5 mm ± 41.2). Stent implantation followed standard interventional techniques and a maximum of two stents could be implanted. The primary endpoint was the in-stent mean lumen diameter at 6 months as determined by quantitative angiography.
RESULTS
Both stent types were effective in revascularizing the diseased SFA and allowing sustained patency for at least 6 months. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the in-stent mean lumen diameter at 6 months (4.94 mm ± 0.69 and 4.76 mm ± 0.54 mm for sirolimus-eluting and bare stent groups, respectively; P = .31). Although the diameter of the target lesion tended to be larger and percent stenosis tended to be lower with the sirolimus-eluting stent, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments in terms of any of the variables. The mean late loss values were 0.38 mm ± 0.64 and 0.68 mm ± 0.97 for the sirolimus-eluting stent group and the bare stent group, respectively (P = .20). The binary restenosis rates, with a cutoff of 50\% at 6 months, were zero in the sirolimus-eluting stent group and 7.7\% in the bare stent group (P = .49). Clinical outcomes matched angiographic outcomes with improvements in ankle-brachial index and symptoms of claudication. There was no significant difference between treatments in terms of adverse events.
CONCLUSION
Although there is a trend for greater efficacy in the sirolimus-eluting stent group, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the variables.},

Patients were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving either external beam irradiation (6 MV photons, total dose 24 Gy in a hypofractionated schedule) plus antiplatelet therapy (EBI group) or antiplatelet therapy alone (control group).ResultsNo procedure-related complications occurred, and all patients of the EBI group received the full dose of 24 Gy. During the long-term follow-up, an overall statistically significant difference was demonstrated in favor of the EBI group patients, regarding both the in-stent (log-rank test, p = 0.0072) and the in-segment binary restenosis (log-rank test, p = 0.0103). The primary patency rates were also significantly better in the EBI group at specific time-points, such as in the first (74.2\% vs 46.5\%, p = 0.019), second (62.5\% vs 33.8\%, p = 0.020), and third (54.6\% vs 29.0\%, p = 0.039) year, respectively. Moreover, the overall clinically driven reintervention rate was significantly lower among patients of the irradiated group (log-rank test, p = 0.038).ConclusionOur long-term follow-up analysis revealed that EBI following femoral artery PTA and stenting significantly reduces restenosis and reintervention rates, while improving primary patency.},

	abstract = {Coronary stenting has revolutionized current perspective of coronary artery disease management. Bare-metal stents (BMS) were introduced in 1994, but long-term results have been shattered by the dual problems of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and stent thrombosis associated with BMS. Though stent thrombosis became much less frequent after the introduction of antiplatelet therapy, restenosis however remained as a significant problem. Intense work on stent development has successfully led to the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in 2002, as an effort to address restenosis problem. First generation DES (sirolimus and paclitaxel eluting) were introduced first and found to be more effective than BMS. The use of first generation DES dealt with the problem of restenosis. But, despite early successes, uncertainty remains on the overall safety, especially for late adverse clinical events such as stent thrombosis. Thus, the second generation (everolimus and zotarolimus eluting) stents were developed and introduced with lower thrombosis rates. Today, in the search for improving the performance of available DES various developments and clinical studies are ongoing. Research and developments is primarily centred on increasing the long-term safety and efficacy of stents.},

For any application within or outside the cardiovascular area, biomaterials are subject to an extended set of requirements in order to establish safe application. These requirements mainly include acceptable biocompatibility and, if the material is to be degraded within the body, safe degradation characteristics. During degradation, biocompatible polymers are broken down into molecules that are metabolized and removed from the body via normal metabolic pathways. Major applications of these polymers include targeted drug delivery systems, resorbable sutures and orthopedic fixation devices. In the cardiovascular area they include biodegradable cardiovascular stents and drug-eluting stent (DES) coatings. This review focuses on general aspects of local drug delivery by implantable polymeric devices, with special emphasis on drug-eluting stents.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To report an interim analysis of whether centered endovascular irradiation with the iridium 192 (192Ir) source immediately after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of de novo femoropopliteal stenoses lowers the restenosis rate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing PTA to treat femoropopliteal stenoses were randomized for prophylaxis against restenosis with centered endovascular irradiation with a 192Ir source (a dose of 14 Gy 2 mm deep to the vessel wall, irradiation group) or no irradiation (control group). Angiographic follow-up was available for 22 patients at 6 months (irradiation group, n = 10) and 12 patients at 12 months (irradiation group, n = 6). Duplex sonography, treadmill testing, and interviews were performed the day before and the day after PTA and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results of angiography, duplex sonography, treadmill testing, and interviews were evaluated with a t test and multivariate analysis of variance (clinical characteristics, χ2 test).RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. Interim analysis of the 6-month follow-up data revealed a trend toward a significantly lower restenosis rate in the irradiation group. The change in the degree of stenosis compared with that after PTA was −14.7\% ± 20.8 (mean ± SD) in the irradiation group versus 37.7\% ± 27.3 in the control group (P = .001) and became even more marked at 12 months (−9.5\% ± 34.5 vs 45.5\% ± 40.7 [P = .03], respectively). The follow-up results of treadmill testing and interviews showed a nonsignificant benefit for the irradiation group. One thromboembolic complication occurred during irradiation. No side effects were observed during follow-up.CONCLUSION: Endovascular irradiation with a centered 192Ir source immediately after PTA of de novo femoropopliteal stenoses reduces the restenosis rate.© RSNA, 2002},

Poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) block copolymer (SIBS), a nanostructured thermoplastic elastomer, is used in clinical practice as the drug-eluting polymeric coating on the Taxus coronary stent (trademark of Boston Scientific Co.). Our group has been developing new architectures comprising of arborescent (dendritic) polyisobutylene cores (D\_SIBS), which were shown to be as biocompatible as SIBS. ElectroNanospray (Nanocopoeia Inc.™) was used to coat test coupons and coronary stents with selected DSIBS polymers loaded with dexamethasone, a model drug. The surface topology varied from smooth to nanosized particulate coating. This paper will demonstrate how drug release profiles were influenced by both the molecular weight of the polyisobutylene core and spraying conditions of the polymer-drug mixture.

	abstract = {Background— Late stent thrombosis (LST) after Cypher and Taxus drug-eluting stent placement has emerged as a major concern. Although the clinical predictors of LST have been reported, specific morphological and histological correlates of LST remain unknown.Methods and Results— From a registry totaling 81 human autopsies of drug-eluting stents, 46 (62 lesions) had a drug-eluting stent implanted {\textgreater}30 days. We identified 28 lesions with thrombus and compared those with 34 of similar duration without thrombosis using computer-guided morphometric and histological analyses. LST was defined as an acute thrombus within a coronary artery stent in place {\textgreater}30 days. Multiple logistic generalized estimating equations modeling demonstrated that endothelialization was the best predictor of thrombosis. The morphometric parameter that best correlated with endothelialization was the ratio of uncovered to total stent struts per section. A univariable logistic generalized estimating equations model of occurrence of thrombus in a stent section versus ratio of uncovered to total stent struts per section demonstrated a marked increase in risk for LST as the number of uncovered struts increased. The odds ratio for thrombus in a stent with a ratio of uncovered to total stent struts per section {\textgreater}30\% is 9.0 (95\% CI, 3.5 to 22).Conclusions— The most powerful histological predictor of stent thrombosis was endothelial coverage. The best morphometric predictor of LST was the ratio of uncovered to total stent struts. Heterogeneity of healing is a common finding in drug-eluting stents with evidence of LST and demonstrates the importance of incomplete healing of the stented segment in the pathophysiology of LST.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether sirolimus and paclitaxel induce molecular and cellular alterations in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial regrowth was assessed in human aortic endothelial cells and rat aortic endothelium. Molecular and cellular alterations were analyzed in human aortic endothelial cells by Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining. Green fluorescent protein-LC3 mice were used to analyze autophagic endothelium. Here, we show that sirolimus and paclitaxel differentially induce self-digesting autophagy in vascular endothelial cells with changes in expression of LC3B, p53, and Bcl-2, considerably suppressing re-endothelialization and revascularization. These results suggest that phenotypic alteration in the endothelium by sirolimus or paclitaxel might affect the rates of late stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and mortality.},

These RNA molecules were of a uniform length, estimated at 25 nucleotides, and their accumulation required either transgene sense transcription or RNA virus replication.

RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression3,4. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21- and 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNAs5,6,7,8,9. Here we show that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and HeLa cells. Therefore, 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes provide a new tool for studying gene function in mammalian cells and may eventually be used as gene-specific therapeutics.},

Whether or not in vivo gene silencing by synthetic siRNA can disrupt the endogenous microRNA (miRNA) pathway remains to be addressed. Here we show that effective target-gene silencing in the mouse and hamster liver can be achieved by systemic administration of synthetic siRNA without any demonstrable effect on miRNA levels or activity. Indeed, siRNA targeting two hepatocyte-specific genes (apolipoprotein B and factor VII) that achieved efficient (∼80\%) silencing of messenger RNA transcripts and a third irrelevant siRNA control were administered to mice without significant changes in the levels of three hepatocyte-expressed miRNAs (miR-122, miR-16 and let-7a) or an effect on miRNA activity. Moreover, multiple administrations of an siRNA targeting the hepatocyte-expressed gene Scap in hamsters achieved long-term mRNA silencing without significant changes in miR-122 levels. This study advances the use of siRNAs as safe and effective tools to silence gene transcripts in animal studies, and supports the continued advancement of RNA interference therapeutics using synthetic siRNA.},

	abstract = {Objective
Intimal hyperplasia is a common cause of vein graft failure in cardiovascular surgery. The molecular basis for intimal hyperplasia remains poorly defined. We have previously identified, by gene chip analysis of vein grafts, increased messenger (mRNA) for the adhesion molecule cadherin 11/osteoblast-cadherin (CDH11). The function of CDH11 in vascular cells is unknown. The aim of the present study is to confirm CDH11 expression in vein grafts and characterize its role in vascular remodeling.
Methods
Cephalic vein interposition grafts were implanted in a canine model and harvested at predetermined time points. CDH11 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Early passage human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were used for in vitro studies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess cellular CDH11 mRNA levels. CDH11 signaling was inhibited by either transfection with silencing RNA targeting CDH11 or with a blocking antibody to CDH11. Cellular migration was evaluated and cellular proliferation was assessed.
Results
Expression of CDH11 was increased in medial SMCs of vein grafts recovered at 7, 14, and 30 days after surgery compared with control veins from the same animals. In vitro CDH11 mRNA was up-regulated 1.8 ± 0.2-fold (P = .003) in SMCs after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α. Cellular migration was attenuated by inhibition of CDH11 both with a blocking antibody (0.67 ± 0.09; P = .063) and gene knockdown mediated by small interfering RNA (0.67 ± 0.14; P = .036). SMC proliferation decreased by 3.1-fold (P = .006) in the presence of CDH11-blocking antibody. Knockdown of CDH11 mediated by small interfering RNA resulted in a 1.3-fold (P = .018) decrease in proliferation.
Conclusions
CDH11 is up-regulated in SMC in vivo and in vitro as part of the response to injury. Inhibition of CDH11 decreases SMC migration and proliferation, two pathogenic effectors of intimal hyperplasia.},

	abstract = {Background Overexpression of the myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) occurs in vascular proliferative diseases such as restenosis after bypass surgery. MARCKS knockdown results in arrest of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation with little effect on endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. We sought to identify the mechanism of differential regulation by MARCKS of VSMC and EC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Results siRNA-mediated MARCKS knockdown in VSMCs inhibited proliferation and prevented progression from phase G0/G1 to S. Protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, but not p21cip1 was increased by MARCKS knockdown. MARCKS knockdown did not affect proliferation in VSMCs derived from p27kip1-/- mice indicating that the effect of MARCKS is p27kip1-dependent. MARCKS knockdown resulted in decreased phosphorylation of p27kip1 at threonine 187 and serine 10 as well as, kinase interacting with stathmin (KIS), cyclin D1, and Skp2 expression. Phosphorylation of p27kip1 at serine 10 by KIS is required for nuclear export and degradation of p27kip1. MARCKS knockdown caused nuclear trapping of p27kip1. Both p27kip1 nuclear trapping and cell cycle arrest were released by overexpression of KIS, but not catalytically inactive KIS. In ECs, MARCKS knockdown paradoxically increased KIS expression and cell proliferation. MARCKS knockdown in a murine aortic injury model resulted in decreased VSMC proliferation determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) integration assay, and inhibition of vascular wall thickening. MARCKS knockdown increased the rate of re-endothelialization. Conclusions MARCKS knockdown arrested VSMC cell cycle by decreasing KIS expression. Decreased KIS expression resulted in nuclear trapping of p27kip1 in VSMCs. MARCKS knockdown paradoxically increased KIS expression in ECs resulting in increased EC proliferation. MARCKS knockdown significantly attenuated the VSMC proliferative response to vascular injury, but accelerated reestablishment of an intact endothelium. MARCKS is a novel translational target with beneficial cell type-specific effects on both ECs and VSMCs.},

MARCKS knockdown inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration in vitro; however, the mechanism is as yet unknown. We sought to elucidate the mechanism of MARCKS‐mediated motility and determine whether MARCKS knockdown reduces intimal hyperplasia formation in vivo.Methods and ResultsMARCKS knockdown blocked platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF)‐induced translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex, impaired both lamellipodia and filopodia formation, and attenuated motility of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs). Activation of the small GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, was prevented by MARCKS knockdown. Phosphorylation of MARCKS resulted in a transient shift of MARCKS from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. MARCKS knockdown significantly decreased membrane‐associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PIP2) levels. Cotransfection with an intact, unphosphorylated MARCKS, which has a high binding affinity for PIP2, restored membrane‐associated PIP2 levels and was indispensable for activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and, ultimately, VSMC migration. Overexpression of MARCKS in differentiated VSMCs increased membrane PIP2 abundance, Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, and cell motility. MARCKS protein was upregulated early in the development of intimal hyperplasia in the murine carotid ligation model. Decreased MARKCS expression, but not total knockdown, attenuated intimal hyperplasia formation.ConclusionsMARCKS upregulation increases VSMC motility by activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. These effects are mediated by MARCKS sequestering PIP2 at the plasma membrane. This study delineates a novel mechanism for MARCKS‐mediated VSMC migration and supports the rational for MARCKS knockdown to prevent intimal hyperplasia.},

Numerous studies have correlated transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) with extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, a hallmark of intimal thickening. Principal Findings In the present study, we performed immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot to examine the dynamic expression of TGF-β1, TGF-β1 receptor type I (TGF-β RI), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) during intimal hyperplasia in grafted veins of a rat model generated by grafting a portion of the right internal jugular vein to the ipisiliary caroid artery. Additionally, we determined whether nanoparticle-mediated delivery of a TGF-β1 antisense-expressing construct prevented TGF-β1 expression and intimal hyperplasia in grafted veins. In grafted veins, the expression of TGF-β1 significantly increased on day 3 after transplantation, peaked on day 7, slightly decreased on day 14, and returned to baseline levels on day 28. The positive expression of TGF-β RI in grafted veins remarkably increased on day 7, peaked on day 14, and decreased thereafter. MMP-1 expression decreased significantly, while TIMP-1 expression increased, significantly on days 14 and 28. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of a TGF-β1 antisense-expressing construct down-regulated TGF-β1 expression and inhibited intimal hyperplasia in grafted veins. Conclusions Our findings provide further evidence that TGF-β1 plays an integral role in the development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury.

Marked induction of focal TLR4 expression was observed in perfused fresh huSV. Moreover, TLR4 was abundantly present in lesions in fresh huSV or in intimal hyperplasia in coronary vein grafts. Second, mouse venous bypass grafting was performed. In grafts of hypercholesterolemic APOE*3Leiden mice, increased TLR4 mRNA and protein was detected over time by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the local presence of the endogenous TLR4 ligands heat shock protein 60, high-mobility group box 1, tenascin-C, and biglycan in the grafts was demonstrated. TLR4 deficiency in C3H-Tlr4LPS-d (LPS indicates lipopolysaccharide) mice resulted in 48±12\% less vein graft wall thickening (P=0.04) than in Balb/c controls. Moreover, local TLR4 gene silencing in hypercholesterolemic APOE*3Leiden mice using lentiviral short hairpin RNA against TLR4 administered perivascularly around vein grafts led to a 44±13\% reduction of vessel wall thickening compared with controls (P=0.0059).Conclusion—These results indicate that TLR4 is involved in vein graft remodeling and can be used as a local therapeutic target against vein graft disease.},

	abstract = {The migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays an essential role during the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Extensive studies have implicated the importance of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteinases in VSMC migration. A recently described family of proteinases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTs), is capable of degrading vascular ECM proteins. Here, we sought to determine whether ADAMTS-7 is involved in VSMC migration and neointima formation in response to vascular injury. ADAMTS-7 protein accumulated preferentially in neointima of the carotid artery wall after balloon injury. In primary VSMCs, ADAMTS-7 level was enhanced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α and growth factor platelet-derived growth factor-BB. ADAMTS-7 overexpression greatly accelerated and small interfering RNA knockdown markedly retarded VSMC migration/invasion in vitro. In addition, luminal delivery of ADAMTS-7 adenovirus to carotid arteries exacerbated intimal thickening nearly sixfold 7 days after injury. Conversely, perivascular administration of ADAMTS-7 small interfering RNA but not scramble small interfering RNA to injured arteries attenuated intimal thickening by 50\% at 14 days after injury. Furthermore, ADAMTS-7 mediated degradation of the vascular ECM cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in injured vessels. Replenishing COMP circumvented the promigratory effect of ADAMTS-7 on VSMCs. Enforced expression of COMP significantly suppressed VSMC migration and neointima formation postinjury, which indicates that ADAMTS-7 facilitated intimal hyperplasia through degradation of inhibitory matrix protein COMP. ADAMTS-7 may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis.},

	abstract = {Objective
Factors responsible for the variability in outcomes after lower extremity vein bypass grafting (LEVBG) are poorly understood. Recent evidence has suggested that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the p27Kip1 gene, a cell-cycle regulator, is associated with coronary in-stent restenosis. We hypothesized an association with vein graft patency.
Methods
This was a retrospective genetic association study nested within a prospective cohort of 204 patients from three referral centers undergoing LEVBG for claudication or critical ischemia. The main outcome measure was primary vein graft patency.
Results
All patients were followed up for a minimum of 1 year with duplex graft surveillance (median follow-up, 893 days; interquartile range, 539-1315). Genomic DNA was isolated and SNP analysis for the p27Kip1-838C{\textgreater}A variants was performed. Allele frequencies were correlated with graft outcome using survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling. The p27Kip1-838C{\textgreater}A allele frequencies observed were CA, 53\%; CC, 30\%; and AA, 17\%, satisfying Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Race (P = .025) and history of coronary artery disease (P = .027) were different across the genotypes; all other baseline variables were similar. Primary graft patency was greater among patients with the -838AA genotype (75\% AA vs 55\% CA/CC at 3 years; P = .029). In a Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, race, diabetes, critical limb ischemia, redo (vs primary) bypass, vein type, and baseline C-reactive protein level, the p27Kip1-838AA genotype was significantly associated with higher graft patency (hazard ratio for failure, 0.4; 95\% confidence interval, 0.17-0.93). Genotype was also associated with early (0-1 month) changes in graft lumen diameter by ultrasound imaging.
Conclusions
These data suggest that the p27Kip1-838C{\textgreater}A SNP is associated with LEVBG patency and, together with previous reports, underscore a central role for p27Kip1 in the generic response to vascular injury.},

	abstract = {Objective
To describe the design and ongoing conduct of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), as an observational cohort study and mega-biobank in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.
Study Design and Setting
Data are being collected from participants using questionnaires, the VA electronic health record, and a blood sample for genomic and other testing. Several ongoing projects are linked to MVP, both as peer-reviewed research studies and as activities to help develop an infrastructure for future, broad-based research uses.
Results
Formal planning for MVP commenced in 2009; the protocol was approved in 2010, and enrollment began in 2011. As of August 3, 2015, and with a steady state of ≈50 recruiting sites nationwide, N = 397,104 veterans have been enrolled. Among N = 199,348 with currently available genotyping data, most participants (as expected) are male (92.0\%) between the ages of 50 and 69 years (55.0\%). On the basis of self-reported race, white (77.2\%) and African American (13.5\%) populations are well represented.
Conclusions
By helping to promote the future integration of genetic testing in health care delivery, including clinical decision making, the MVP is designed to contribute to the development of precision medicine.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with autologous vein grafting is commonly performed. Progressive neointimal hyperplasia, however, contributes to considerable vein graft failure. Edifoligide is an oligonucleotide decoy that binds to and inhibits E2F transcription factors and thus may prevent neointimal hyperplasia and vein graft failure.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of pretreating vein grafts with edifoligide for patients undergoing CABG surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 3014 patients undergoing primary CABG surgery with at least 2 planned saphenous vein grafts and without concomitant valve surgery, who were enrolled between August 2002 and October 2003 at 107 US sites.
INTERVENTION: Vein grafts were treated ex vivo with either edifoligide or placebo in a pressure-mediated delivery system. The first 2400 patients enrolled were scheduled for 12- to 18-month follow-up angiography.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was angiographic vein graft failure ({\textgreater} or =75\% vein graft stenosis) occurring 12 to 18 months after CABG surgery. Other end points included other angiographic variables, adverse events through 30 days, and major adverse cardiac events.
RESULTS: A total of 1920 patients (80\%) either died (n = 91) or underwent follow-up angiography (n = 1829). Edifoligide had no effect on the primary end point of per patient vein graft failure (436 [45.2\%] of 965 patients in the edifoligide group vs 442 [46.3\%] of 955 patients in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.96 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 0.80-1.14]; P = .66), on any secondary angiographic end point, or on the incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 1 year (101 [6.7\%] of 1508 patients in the edifoligide group vs 121 [8.1\%] of 1506 patients in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.64-1.08]; P = .16).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure of at least 1 vein graft is quite common within 12 to 18 months after CABG surgery. Edifoligide is no more effective than placebo in preventing these events. Longer-term follow-up and additional research are needed to determine whether edifoligide has delayed beneficial effects, to understand the mechanisms and clinical consequences of vein graft failure, and to improve the durability of CABG surgery.

	abstract = {Intimal hyperplasia (IH) limits the patency of all cardiovascular vein bypass grafts. We previously found the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a key protein kinase C (PKC) substrate, to be up-regulated in canine models of IH. Here, we further characterize the role of MARCKS in IH and examine the phenotypic consequences of MARCKS silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro and use a rapid 10-min nonviral siRNA transfection technique to determine the effects of MARCKS silencing in human saphenous vein cultured ex vivo. We demonstrate MARCKS silencing attenuates VSMC migration and arrests VSMC proliferation in part through the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1. Conversely, MARCKS silencing had little or no effect on EC migration or proliferation. These phenotypic changes culminated in reduced neointimal formation in cultured human saphenous vein. These data identify MARCKS as a pathogenic contributor to IH and indicate therapeutic MARCKS silencing could selectively suppress the “atherogenic,” proliferative phenotype of VSMCs without collateral harm to the endothelium. This approach could be readily translated to the clinic to silence MARCKS in vein bypass grafts prior to implantation.—Monahan, T. S., Andersen, N. D., Martin, M. C., Malek, J. Y., Shrikhande, G.

We use probe-tack adhesion measurements accompanied by in situ imaging of the contact region during bonding and debonding. Within the probe-tack tests, we use both hydrophilic (piranha and plasma treatment) and hydrophobic (C18-silanization) surface treatments to investigate the contribution of the probe’s surface energy on the underwater adhesion. In examining contact formation in air and underwater, we find that the presence of water when contact is made leads to different modes of PSA relaxation and contact formation. For all probes investigated, the adhesive strength between the PSA and the probe decreases when measured underwater. Additionally, we observe that the presence of water during debonding has a more pronounced effect on the adhesive strength of the PSA when probed by a hydrophilic surface as opposed to a hydrophobic surface. Using fingering wavelength analysis, we estimate the surface energy of the PSA in situ and find that when submerged in water, the PSA has a significantly higher surface energy compared to in air. Therefore, combining the observation of different modes of contact formation, the increase in surface energy, and the importance of the surface energy of the probe, we suggest that the decrease in adhesive strength in water can be explained by the hydration of the PSA and by trapped water defects between the PSA and the probe.},

	abstract = {Maintaining the underwater adhesive performance over a broad range of solution pH is challenging but necessary for many biomedical applications. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the mechanisms of bonding and debonding of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) can provide guidelines for materials design. We investigate how the presence of acrylic acid as a co-monomer impacts the adhesion of a model PSA in aqueous environments of varying pH. The adhesives under investigation are poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate), or poly(2-EHA), and poly(2-EHA) co-polymerized with 5 wt \% acrylic acid, or poly(2-EHA-co-AA). We characterize bonding and debonding (adhesion) of the adhesives using probe tack measurements with a spherical hydrophobic glass probe. We analyze the performance of the two PSAs in air and in low-ionic-strength buffered aqueous solutions of pH 3– 11. We find that the presence of the acrylic acid co-monomer increases the cohesiveness of the PSA and leads to stronger adhesion under all conditions investigated. We also observe that the presence of the acrylic acid co-monomer imparts the PSA with a strong dependence of adhesion on the solution pH. Dynamic contact angle and  ζ potential measurements support the hypothesis that deprotonation of the acrylic acid groups at higher pH causes the decrease in adhesion at higher pH. Rheological measurements do not show changes in the dynamic mechanical properties of the PSAs after exposure to solutions of pH 3– 11. Our measurements allow us to isolate the effect of the solution pH on the surface and bulk properties of the PSA. In the absence of the acrylic acid co-monomer, the bulk dissipation and the surface properties of the PSA are independent of the solution’s pH.},

The mechanisms underlying the strong adhesion of these natural adhesive proteins provide rich information for biomimetic efforts. Here, combining atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force spectroscopy, we examine the effects of pH on the self-assembly and adhesive properties of cp19k, a key barnacle underwater adhesive protein. For the first time, we confirm that the bacterial recombinant Balanus albicostatus cp19k (rBalcp19k), which contains no 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) or any other amino acids with post-translational modifications, can self-assemble into aggregated nanofibers at acidic pHs. Under moderately acidic conditions, the adhesion strength of unassembled monomeric rBalcp19k on mica is only slightly lower than that of a commercially available mussel adhesive protein mixture, yet the adhesion ability of rBalcp19k monomers decreases significantly at increased pH. In contrast, upon preassembly at acidic and low-salinity conditions, rBalcp19k nanofibers keep stable in basic and high-salinity seawater and display much stronger adhesion and thus show resistance to its adverse impacts. Besides, we find that the adhesion ability of Balcp19k is not impaired when it is combined with an N-terminal Thioredoxin (Trx) tag, yet whether the self-assembly property will be disrupted is not determined. Collectively, the self-assembly-enhanced adhesion presents a previously unexplored mechanism for the strong wet adhesion of barnacle cement proteins and may lead to the design of barnacle-inspired adhesive materials.},

Although cytoreductive surgery combined with chemotherapy is considered a promising therapy, peritoneal adhesion causes further complications after surgery. In this study, oxaliplatin-loaded Poly-(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were prepared using a double emulsion method and loaded into hyaluronic acid (HA)- and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMCNa)-based cross-linked (HC) hydrogels. From characterization and evaluation study PLGA microparticles showed smaller particle size with higher entrapment eﬃciency, approximately 1100.4 ± 257.7 nm and 77.9 ± 2.8\%, respectively. In addition, microparticle-loaded hydrogels showed more sustained drug release compared to the unloaded microparticles. Moreover, in an in vivo pharmacokinetic study after intraperitoneal administration in rats, a signiﬁcant improvement in the bioavailability and the mean residence time of the microparticle-loaded hydrogels was observed. In HC21 hydrogels, AUC0–48h, Cmax, and Tmax were 16012.12 ± 188.75 ng·h/mL, 528.75 ± 144.50 ng/mL, and 1.5 h, respectively. Furthermore, experimental observation revealed that the hydrogel samples eﬀectively protected injured tissues from peritoneal adhesion. Therefore, the results of the current pharmacokinetic study together with our previous report of the in vivo anti-adhesion eﬃcacy of HC hydrogels demonstrated that the PLGA microparticle-loaded hydrogels oﬀer novel therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment.},

	abstract = {The combination of multiple physiological (swelling, porosity, mechanical, and biodegradation) and biological (cell/tissue-adhesive, cell proliferation, and hemostatic) properties on a single hydrogel has great potential for skin tissue engineering. Adhesive hydrogels based on polydopamine (PDA) have become the most popular in the biomedical ﬁeld; however, integrating multiple properties on a single adhesive hydrogel remains a challenge. Here, inspired by the chemistry of mussels, we developed PDA−sodium alginate− polyacrylamide (PDA−SA−PAM)-based hydrogels with multiple physiological and biological properties for skin tissue engineering applications. The hydrogels were prepared by alkali-induced polymerization of DA followed by complexation with SA in PAM networks. The chemical composition of the hydrogels was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. PDA−SA complexed chains were homogeneously dispersed in the PAM network and exhibited good elasticity and excellent mechanical properties, such as a compressive stress of 0.24 MPa at a compression strain of 70\% for 0.4PDA−SA−PAM. The adhesive hydrogel also maintained a highly interconnected porous structure (∼94\% porosity) along with PDA microﬁbrils. The hydrogel possesses outstanding swelling and biodegradability properties. Owing to the presence of the PDA−SA complex in the PAM network, the hydrogels show good adhesion to various substrates (plastic, skin, glass, computer screens, and leaves); for example, the adhesive strength of the 0.4PDA−SA−PAM to porcine skin was 24.5 kPa. The adhesive component of the PDA− SA chains in the PAM network signiﬁcantly improves the cell proliferation, cell attachment, cell spreading, and functional expression of human skin ﬁbroblasts (CCD-986sk) and keratinocytes. Moreover, the PDA chains exhibited good hemostatic properties, resulting in rapid blood coagulation. Considering their excellent cell aﬃnity, and rapid blood coagulation ability, these mussel-inspired hydrogels have substantial potential for skin tissue engineering applications.},

	abstract = {Synthetic polymers, especially those with biocompatible and biodegradable characteristics, may offer effective alternatives for the treatment of severe wounds and burn injuries. Ideally, the scaffold material should induce as little pain as possible, enable quick healing, and direct the growth of defect-free epidermal cells. The best material with this multifunctionality, such as selfhealing dressings, should be hydrophilic and have uninterrupted and direct contact with the damaged tissue. In addition, the ideal biomaterial should have some antibacterial properties. In this study, a novel technique was used to fabricate composite electrospun wound-dressing nanofibers composed of polyurethane encasing lavender oil and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs). After electrospinning, the fabricated nanofibers were identified using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An abundance of Ag NPs in the fibers decreased the diameter of the fibers while increased concentration of the lavender oil increased the diameter. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Xray diffraction (XRD) studies showed the presence of the lavender oil and Ag NPs in the fiber dressings. The Ag NPs and lavender oil improved the hydrophilicity of the nanofibers and ensured the proliferation of chicken embryo fibroblasts cultured in-vitro on these fiber dressings. The antibacterial efficiency of the nanofiber dressings was investigated using E. coli and S. aureus, which yielded zones of inhibition of 16.2 ± 0.8 and 5.9 ± 0.5 mm, respectively, indicating excellent bactericidal properties of the dressings. The composite nanofiber dressings have great potential to be used as multifunctional wound dressings; offering protection against external agents as well as promoting the regeneration of new tissue.},

New materials based on poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) are prepared by solution blow spinning, SBS. Mats of nanocomposites constituted by micrometric ﬁbers are obtained with compositions ranging from 0\% to 6\% by weight of Cu nanoparticles, CuNp. In order to understand the eﬀect of the CuNp on the E. coli cell adhesion and bioﬁlm formation, morphology, structure, thermal and surface properties of the nanocomposites are studied by several techniques. SBS allows preparing the nanocomposites with quite uniform dispersion of CuNp within the polymer. Neither the presence of CuNp nor the SBS process induce changes in the structure and in the thermo-degradation of EVA40. The presence of CuNp exerts antibacterial eﬀect against the DH5α E. coli. There is a direct action of the CuNp on the extracellular polymeric substances and on the bacterial metabolism. CuNp also aﬀect HaCaT cells growing, delaying the process at higher amounts of Cu but keeping their viability.},

Considering that 90\% of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis, antimetastatic therapeutic strategies that can target disseminating tumor cells in the circulation before they can form secondary tumors hold preclinical and clinical potential for cancer patients. Our current work uses a liposomal formulation functionalized with the adhesion receptor E-selectin and the apoptosis-inducing ligand TNF (tumor necrosis factor)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to reduce metastasis following tumor resection in an aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model. We demonstrate that minimal administration of E-selectin–TRAIL liposomes can target metastasis in a TNBC model, with primary tumor resection to mimic clinical settings. Our study indicates that TRAIL liposomes, alone or in combination with existing clinically approved therapies, may neutralize distant metastasis of a broad range of tumor types systemically.},

Accordingly, there is an unmet need for transparent biomaterials that have high adhesion, cohesion, and regenerative properties. Herein, we engineer a highly biocompatible and transparent bioadhesive for corneal reconstruction using a visible light cross-linkable, naturally derived polymer, GelCORE (gel for corneal regeneration). The physical properties of GelCORE could be finely tuned by changing prepolymer concentration and photocrosslinking time. GelCORE revealed higher tissue adhesion compared to commercial adhesives. Furthermore, in situ photopolymerization of GelCORE facilitated easy delivery to the cornea, allowing for bioadhesive curing precisely according to the required geometry of the defect. In vivo experiments, using a rabbit stromal defect model, showed that bioadhesive could effectively seal corneal defects and induce stromal regeneration and re-epithelialization. Overall, GelCORE has many advantages including low cost and ease of production and use. This makes GelCORE a promising bioadhesive for corneal repair.},

Despite the widespread use of electroconductive biomaterials to increase the physiological relevance of bioengineered cardiac tissues in vitro, there are still several limitations associated with engineering biocompatible scaﬀolds with appropriate mechanical properties and electroconductivity for cardiac tissue regeneration. Here, we introduce highly adhesive ﬁbrous scaﬀolds engineered by electrospinning of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) followed by the conjugation of a choline-based bio-ionic liquid (Bio-IL) to develop conductive and adhesive cardiopatches. These GelMA/Bio-IL adhesive patches were optimized to exhibit mechanical and conductive properties similar to the native myocardium. Furthermore, the engineered patches strongly adhered to murine myocardium due to the formation of ionic bonding between the Bio-IL and native tissue, eliminating the need for suturing. Co-cultures of primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac ﬁbroblasts grown on GelMA/Bio-IL patches exhibited comparatively better contractile proﬁles compared to pristine GelMA controls, as demonstrated by over-expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43. These cardiopatches could be used to provide mechanical support and restore electromechanical coupling at the site of MI to minimize cardiac remodeling and preserve normal cardiac function.},

Here, we present novel active adhesive dressings consisting of thermoresponsive tough adhesive hydrogels that combine high stretchability, toughness, tissue adhesion, and antimicrobial function. They adhere strongly to the skin and actively contract wounds, in response to exposure to the skin temperature. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate their efficacy in accelerating and supporting skin wound healing.

	abstract = {Polymer networks, which are materials composed of many smaller components —referred to as “junctions” and “strands”— connected together via covalent or non-covalent/supramolecular interactions, are arguably the most versatile, widely studied, broadly used, and important materials known. From the first commercial polymers through the plastics revolution of the 20th century to today, there are almost no aspects of modern life that are not impacted by polymer networks. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that must be addressed to enable a complete understanding of these materials and facilitate their development for emerging applications ranging from sustainability and energy harvesting/storage to tissue engineering and additive manufacturing. Here, we provide a unifying overview of the fundamentals of polymer network synthesis, structure, and properties, tying together recent trends in the field that are not always associated with classical polymer networks, such as the advent of crystalline “framework” materials. We also highlight recent advances in using molecular design and control of topology to showcase how a deep understanding of structure-property relationships can lead to advanced networks with exceptional properties.},

	abstract = {Background: A novel injectable expanding foam based on hydrophobically modiﬁed chitosan (HM-CS) was developed to improve hemostasis during surgeries. HM-CS is an amphiphilic derivative of the natural biopolymer chitosan (CS); HM-CS has been shown to improve the natural hemostatic characteristics of CS, but its internal safety has not been systematically evaluated. The goal of this study was to compare the long-term in vivo safety of HM-CS relative to a commonly used ﬁbrin sealant (FS), TISSEEL (Baxter).
Methods: Sixty-four SpragueeDawley rats (275-325 g obtained from Charles River Laboratories) were randomly assigned to control (n ¼ 16) or experimental (n ¼ 48) groups. Samples of the test materials (HM-CS [n ¼ 16], CS [n ¼ 16], and FS [n ¼ 16]) applied to a nonlethal liver excision (0.4 Æ 0.3 g of the medial lobe) in rats were left inside the abdomen to degrade. Animals were observed daily for signs of morbidity and mortality. Surviving animals were sacriﬁced at 1 and 6 wk; the explanted injury sites were microscopically assessed.
Results: All animals (64/64) survived both the 1- and 6-wk time points without signs of morbidity. Histological examination showed a comparable pattern of degradation for the various test materials. FS remnants and signiﬁcant adhesions to neighboring tissues were observed at 6 wk. Residual CS and HM-CS were observed at the 6 wk with fatty deposits at the site of injury. Minimal adhesions were observed for CS and HM-CS.
Conclusions: The internal safety observed in the HM-CS test group after abdominal implantation indicates that injectable HM-CS expanding foam may be an appropriate internal use hemostatic candidate.},

PDA sponge with low cytotoxicity and hemolysis achieves eﬀective hemostasis and remarkable blood loss reduction in the ear vein, femoral artery and liver injuries of rabbit models. Furthermore, the exploration of hemostatic mechanisms related to tissue, blood, plasma, cells and coagulation system indicates that PDA sponge can signiﬁcantly accelerate coagulation by rapid wound block, fast cells aggregation and initiation, and high coagulation factors concentration, instead of by the coagulation cascade activation. Importantly, this hemostat exhibits excellent biodegradability and nearly no skin irritation. Overall, the biodegradable and tissue adhesive PDA sponge will be a promising quick-hemostatic dressing for uncontrollable hemorrhage.},

Structurally, SF consists of a heavy chain and a light chain connected via a single disulﬁde bond. The HC sequence is organized into 12 crystalline domains interspersed with amorphous regions that can transition between random coil/α-helix and beta-sheet conﬁgurations, giving silk its hallmark properties. SF has been reported to have adhesive properties and shows promise for development of medical adhesives; however, the mechanism of these interactions and the interplay between SF’s structure and adhesion are not understood. In this context, the eﬀects of physical parameters (i.e., concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength) and protein structural changes on adhesion were investigated in this study. Our results suggest that amino acid side chains that have functionalities capable of coordinate (dative) bond or hydrogen bond formation (such as those of serine and tyrosine) might be important determinants in SF’s adhesion to a given substrate. Additionally, the data suggest that ﬁbroin amino acids involved in beta-sheet formation are also important in the protein’s adhesion to substrates.},

	abstract = {Autologous cell transplantation was introduced to clinical practice nearly four decades ago to enhance burn wound re-epithelialisation. Autologous cultured or uncultured cells are often delivered to the surface in saline-like suspensions. This delivery method is limited because droplets of the sprayed suspension form upon deposition and run across the wound bed, leading to uneven coverage and cell loss. One way to circumvent this problem would be to use a gel-based material to enhance surface retention. Fibrin systems have been explored as co-delivery system with keratinocytes or as adjunct to ‘seal’ the cells following spray delivery, but the high costs and need for autologous blood has impeded its widespread use. Aside from ﬁbrin gel, which can exhibit variable properties, it has not been possible to develop a gelbased carrier that solidiﬁes on the skin surface. This is because it is challenging to develop a material that is sprayable but gels on contact with the skin surface. The manuscript reports the use of an engineered carrier device to deliver cells via spraying, to enhance retention upon a wound. The device involves shear-structuring of a gelling biopolymer, gellan, during the gelation process; forming a yield-stress ﬂuid with shear-sensitive behaviours, known as a ﬂuid gel. In this study, a formulation of gellan gum ﬂuid gels are reported, formed with from 0.75 or 0.9\% (w/v) polymer and varying the salt concentrations. The rheological properties and the propensity of the material to wet a surface were determined for polymer modiﬁed and non-polymer modiﬁed cell suspensions. The gellan ﬂuid gels had a signiﬁcantly higher viscosity and contact angle when compared to the non-polymer carrier. Viability of cells was not impeded by encapsulation in the gellan ﬂuid gel or spraying. The shear thinning property of the material enabled it to be applied using an airbrush and spray angle, distance and air pressure were optimised for coverage and viability.},

In this work, the mechanical behavior of hydrogels consisting of positively charged chitosan and negatively charged sodium hyaluronate (HA) at balanced charge composition is investigated. These hydrogels exhibit strong tensile strain and strain rate dependence. They are elastic-like, independent of the strain rate at small strain, but exhibit plastic-like behavior above the yield point by showing a monotonous decrease of the stress. The cyclic tensile test demonstrates that these hydrogels exhibit small and quickly recoverable hysteresis in the elastic-like region but large and partially recoverable hysteresis above the yield point. The stress relaxation experiment shows a plateau in the reduced stress followed by an abrupt fracture, and the time to failure decreases exponentially with increasing applied step strain. Such elastic-to-plastic-like transformation of the biopolymer PEC gels is quite diﬀerent from the behaviors of PEC hydrogels formed by oppositely charged vinyl-type synthetic polyelectrolytes due to the diﬀerence in ﬂexibility, charge density, and ionic bond strength of these polymers.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an emerging biofabrication technology, driving many innovations and opening new avenues in regenerative therapeutics. The aim of 3D bioprinting is to fabricate grafts in vitro, which can then be implanted in vivo. However, the tissue culture ex vivo carries safety risks and thereby complicated manufacturing equipment and practice are required for tissues to be implanted in the humans. The implantation of printed tissues also adds complexities due to the difficulty in maintaining the structural integrity of fabricated constructs. To tackle this challenge, the concept of in situ 3D bioprinting has been suggested in which tissues are directly printed at the site of injury or defect. Such approach could be combined with cells freshly isolated from patients to produce custom-made grafts that resemble target tissue and fit precisely to target defects. Moreover, the natural cellular microenvironment in the body can be harnessed for tissue maturation resulting in the tissue regeneration and repair. Here, we discuss literature reports on in situ 3D printing and we describe future directions and challenges for in situ 3D bioprinting. We expect that this novel technology would find great attention in different biomedical fields in near future.},

	abstract = {It is notoriously difficult to adhere water-rich materials such as hydrogels and biological tissues. Existing adhesives usually suffer from weak and unadjustable adhesion strength partially because the contact between adhesives and substrates is largely restrained to the adhesive/substrate interface. Here, we approach this challenge by developing a class of diffusive adhesives (DAs) that can extend adhesion deep into the substrate to maximize adhesive/substrate contact. The DAs consist of hydrogel matrices and preloaded water-soluble monomers and crosslinkers, which will diffuse extensively into the water-rich substrates after adhesive/substrate contact. Then polymerization and crosslinking are triggered for the monomers to form a bridging network that interpenetrates with DA and substrate skeletons and topologically binds them together. Such kind of adhesion, in the absence of adhesive/substrate covalent bonding, is of high strength and toughness comparable to those of the best-performing natural and artificial adhesives. More importantly, we can precisely tune the adhesion strength on demand by manipulating the diffusion profile. It is envisioned that the DA family can be enriched from a large pool of hydrogel matrices and monomers and that they could be particularly useful in biological and medical applications.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Surgical adhesives are increasingly used for vocal fold microsurgery to assist wound closure and reduce the risks of scar formation. Currently used vocal fold adhesives such as ﬁbrin glue, however, have thus far not been found to promote wound closure or reduce scarring. The objectives of this study were to investigate the mechanical strength and the cytotoxicity of three commercially available adhesives (Glubran 2, GEM, Viareggio, Italy; BioGlue, CryoLife, Kennesaw, GA; and Tisseel, Baxter Healthcare, Deerﬁeld, IL) for vocal fold wound closure.
Methods: Shear and tension tests were performed on 150 porcine larynges. The cytotoxicity of the adhesives to immortalized human vocal fold ﬁbroblasts was investigated using neutral red uptake assays.
Results: The average shear adhesive strength for Tisseel, BioGlue, and Glubran 2 was 13.86 Æ 5.03 kilopascal (kPa), 40.92 Æ 17.94 kPa, and 68.79 Æ 13.29 kPa, respectively. The tensile adhesive strength for Tisseel, BioGlue, and Glubran 2 was 10.70 Æ 6.42 kPa, 34.27 Æ 12.59 kPa, and 46.67 Æ 12.13 kPa, respectively. The vocal fold cell viabilities in extracts of Tisseel, BioGlue, and Glubran 2 were 99.27\%, 43.05\%, and 1.79\%, respectively.
Conclusion: There was a clear tradeoff between adhesive strength and toxicity. The maximum failure strength in shear or tension of the three surgical adhesives ranked from strongest to the weakest was: 1) Glubran 2, 2) BioGlue, and 3) Tisseel. Tisseel was found to be the least toxic of the three adhesives, whereas Glubran 2 was the most toxic.},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of heart failure. However, current MSC-delivery methods result in poor donor cell engraftment, limiting the therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, we introduce here a novel technique, epicardial placement of bi-layered, adhesive dressings incorporating MSCs (MSC-dressing), which can be easily fabricated from a fibrin sealant film and MSC suspension at the site of treatment. The inner layer of the MSC dressing, an MSC-fibrin complex, promptly and firmly adheres to the heart surface without sutures or extra glues. We revealed that fibrin improves the potential of integrated MSCs through amplifying their tissue-repair abilities and activating the Akt/PI3K self-protection pathway. Outer collagen-sheets protect the MSC-fibrin complex from abrasion by surrounding tissues and also facilitates easy handling. As such, the MSC-dressing technique not only improves initial retention and subsequent maintenance of donor MSCs but also augment MSC's reparative functions. As a result, this technique results in enhanced cardiac function recovery with improved myocardial tissue repair in a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model, compared to the current method. Dose-dependent therapeutic effects by this therapy is also exhibited. This user-friendly, highly-effective bioengineering technique will contribute to future success of MSC-based therapy.},

	abstract = {Soft tissue losses from tumor removal, trauma, aging, and congenital malformation affect millions of people each year. Existing options for soft tissue restoration have several drawbacks: Surgical options such as the use of autologous tissue flaps lead to donor site defects, prosthetic implants are prone to foreign body response leading to fibrosis, and fat grafting and dermal fillers are limited to small-volume defects and only provide transient volume restoration. In addition, large-volume fat grafting and other tissue-engineering attempts are hampered by poor vascular ingrowth. Currently, there are no off-the-shelf materials that can fill the volume lost in soft tissue defects while promoting early angiogenesis. Here, we report a nanofiber-hydrogel composite that addresses these issues. By incorporating interfacial bonding between electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) fibers and a hyaluronic acid hydrogel network, we generated a composite that mimics the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of soft tissue extracellular matrix. Upon subcutaneous injection in a rat model, this composite permitted infiltration of host macrophages and conditioned them into the pro-regenerative phenotype. By secreting pro-angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, these polarized macrophages enabled gradual remodeling and replacement of the composite with vascularized soft tissue. Such host cell infiltration and angiogenesis were also observed in a rabbit model for repairing a soft tissue defect filled with the composite. This injectable nanofiber-hydrogel composite augments native tissue regenerative responses, thus enabling durable soft tissue restoration outcomes.},

	abstract = {We hypothesized that ingested warm fluids could act as triggers for biomedical devices. We investigated heat dissipation throughout the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract by administering warm (55°C) water to pigs and identified two zones in which thermal actuation could be applied: esophageal (actuation through warm water ingestion) and extra-esophageal (protected from ingestion of warm liquids and actuatable by endoscopically administered warm fluids). Inspired by a blooming flower, we developed a capsule-sized esophageal system that deploys using elastomeric elements and then recovers its original shape in response to thermal triggering of shape-memory nitinol springs by ingestion of warm water. Degradable millineedles incorporated into the system could deliver model molecules to the esophagus. For the extra-esophageal compartment, we developed a highly flexible macrostructure (mechanical metamaterial) that deforms into a cylindrical shape to safely pass through the esophagus and deploys into a fenestrated spherical shape in the stomach, capable of residing safely in the gastric cavity for weeks. The macrostructure uses thermoresponsive elements that dissociate when triggered with the endoscopic application of warm (55°C) water, allowing safe passage of the components through the GI tract. Our gastric-resident platform acts as a gram-level long-lasting drug delivery dosage form, releasing small-molecule drugs for 2 weeks. We anticipate that temperature-triggered systems could usher the development of the next generation of stents, drug delivery, and sensing systems housed in the GI tract.},

In addition, the mechanical performance as well as the morphology of these fiber mats were investigated. Thus, the morphology of fiber mats composed of neat PLA and PLA containing DEX and BET was homogeneous with bead-free surface, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the presence of DEX in the fiber mats resulted in significant increase of the tensile strength. Then, the release of these drugs from the electrospun mats was evaluated by UV-VIS spectroscopy showing that BET-loaded PLA presented better release profile than DEX-loaded PLA. After a burst release of around 34 and 28\% for DEX- and BET-loaded PLA, respectively, during the first 5 h, both drugs were continuously released reaching a maximum of around 60 and 80 \% after 168 h for membranes loaded with 14\% of DEX and BET, respectively. Moreover, the drug release efficiency was compared with PLA electrospun fiber mats having adsorbed drug prepared by solution casting. In summary, we have demonstrated that PLA/BET and PLA/DEX electrospun membranes present a promising drug delivery system for sustained release in topical applications.},

	abstract = {Bioadhesives such as tissue adhesives, hemostatic agents, and tissue sealants have gained increasing popularity in different areas of clinical operations during the last three decades. Bioadhesives can be categorized into internal and external ones according to their application conditions. External bioadhesives are generally applied in topical medications such as wound closure and epidermal grafting. Internal bioadhesives are mainly used in intracorporal conditions with direct contact to internal environment including tissues, organs and body ﬂuids, such as chronic organ leak repair and bleeding complication reduction. This review focuses on internal bioadhesives that, in contrast with external bioadhesives, emphasize much more on biocompatibility and adhesive ability to wet surfaces rather than on gluing time and intensity. The crosslinking mechanisms of present internal bioadhesives can be generally classiﬁed as follows: 1) chemical conjugation between reactive groups; 2) free radical polymerization by light or redox initiation; 3) biological or biochemical coupling with speciﬁcity; and 4) biomimetic adhesion inspired from natural phenomena. In this review, bioadhesive products of each class are summarized and discussed by comparing their designs, features, and applications as well as their prospects for future development.},

The cell sheet harvest and transfer processes were performed simpler and faster than those without using the GHNF. The lactate/glucose ratio of a metabolic activity was significantly lower and the ATP production was higher for the 3‐layered cell sheets formulated with the GHNF than that without the GHNF.

This allows us to dynamically switch the particle organization between a highly crystalline (under light) and a disordered (in dark) phase, with a fast response time (crystallization in {\textasciitilde}10 s, disassembly in {\textasciitilde}1 min). These results evidence a new kind of dissipative system where the crystalline state can be maintained only upon energy supply.},

Here, we report a variation in additive-free viscoelastic conjugated polymers (VE-CPs) at room temperature, comprising of an intact πconjugated backbone and bulky yet flexible alkyl side chains as “internal plasticizers.” Some of these polymers exhibit gel- and elastomer-like rheological behaviors without crosslinking or entanglement. Furthermore, binary blends of these VE-CPs exhibit a never-seen-before dynamic miscibility with self-restorable and mechanically induced fluorescence color changes.},

A promising approach to control NP positions in polymer matrices at the nanometer scale is the use of block copolymers. It allows the selective deposition of NPs in nanodomains, but the final defined and ordered positioning of the NPs within the domains has not been possible. This can now be achieved by coating NPs with block copolymers. The self-assembly of block copolymercoated NPs directly leads to ordered microdomains containing ordered NP arrays with exactly one NP per unit cell. By variation of the grafting density, the inter-nanoparticle distance can be controlled from direct NP surface contact to surface separations of several nanometers, determined by the thickness of the polymer shell. The method can be applied to a wide variety of block copolymers and NPs and is thus suitable for a broad range of applications.},

An in depth understanding of PLGA polymers is critical for development of depot formulations as their properties control drug release kinetics. To date, about 20 PLGA-based formulations have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through new drug applications, and none of them have generic counterparts on the market yet. The lack of generic PLGA products is partly due to diﬃculties in reverse engineering. A generic injectable PLGA product is required to establish qualitative and quantitative (Q1/ Q2) sameness of PLGA to that of a reference listed drug (RLD) to obtain an approval from the FDA. Conventional characterizations of PLGA used in a formulation rely on measuring the molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) based on polystyrene molecular weight standards, and determining the lactide:glycolide (L: G) ratio by 1H NMR and the end-group by 13C NMR. These approaches, however, may not be suitable or suﬃcient, if a formulation has more than one type of PLGA, especially when they have similar molecular weights, but diﬀerent L:G ratios. Accordingly, there is a need to develop new assay methods for separating PLGAs possessing diﬀerent L:G ratios when used in a drug product and characterizing individual PLGAs.},

However, the integration of physical isolation and pharmaceutical therapy in one platform faces many challenges. First, normal polymer antiadhesion membranes are hydrophobic and show low bioadhesion to the injured tissue, which decrease their eﬃcacies. Second, the signiﬁcantly diﬀerent release behaviors of various drugs owing to their diﬀerent hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties limit their synergistic eﬀects. In this study, a highly bioadhesive polymer membrane formed by core−sheath nanoﬁber to integrate physical isolation and pharmaceutical treatment together for the synergistic prevention of peritoneal adhesion. 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and diclofenac sodium (DS) were loaded in the sheath and core of nanoﬁber, respectively. The membrane was then treated by ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) for improvement of hydrophilicity and bioadhesion. Owing to the core−sheath structure, the two drugs both performed a sustained release behavior for the cytostatic and anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects. The in vivo study demonstrated that the UVO-treated and dual-drug-coloaded membrane possessed the best antiadhesion capacity, indicating its potential clinical application.},

Unequal reactivity of functional groups was observed in the step-growth polymerization.

Here, we developed an injectable microparticle formulation of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) that releases multiple pulses of stable antigen over time. To accomplish this, we established an IPV stabilization strategy using cationic polymers for pH modulation to enhance traditional small-molecule–based stabilization methods. We investigated the mechanism of this strategy and showed that it was broadly applicable to all three antigens in IPV. Our lead formulations released two bursts of IPV 1 month apart, mimicking a typical vaccination schedule in the developing world. One injection of the controlled-release formulations elicited a similar or better neutralizing response in rats, considered the correlate of protection in humans, than multiple injections of liquid vaccine. This single-administration vaccine strategy has the potential to improve vaccine coverage in the developing world.},

	abstract = {To reﬂect the rapidly growing interest in producing tissue sealants using various chemical/physical processes, we report an approach using visible light to control the crosslinking of 3D printable hydrogels as in situ tissue sealant. Gelatin-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid conjugate (Gtn-HPA) is shown to crosslink effectively within 30 s under visible light in the presence of [RuII(bpy)3]2+ and sodium persulphate, which is sufﬁciently rapid for surgery use. Porous structure can be also introduced by including carboxylmethyl cellulose-tyramine (CMC-Tyr) as a precursor. The detailed parameters involved in the hydrogel formation, including irradiation time and distance, are investigated in this study. The results suggested that a longer exposure time would result in a hydrogel with higher crosslinking density, while sufﬁcient photocrosslinking can be achieved using a routine visible light source at a distance of 100 mm. Surface morphology of the photocrosslinked hydrogels are studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental SEM with results conﬁrming the expected porosity. The tensile strength of the photocrosslinked hydrogels has been tested for both non-porous and porous samples. Notably, the adhesive strengths (adhesion) of the photocrosslinked hydrogels was demonstrated to be signiﬁcantly higher compared to that of commercial ﬁbrin glue. Finally, a prototype of hand-held applicator has been developed and demonstrated to print out Gtn-HPA/CMC-Tyr hydrogel of designed properties with controlled spatial resolution. The development of both material and applicator in this study provides a promising tissue sealant solution for wound closure in future surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {Adhesives are ubiquitous in daily life and industrial applications. They usually fall into one of two classes: strong but irreversible (e.g., superglues) or reversible/reusable but weak (e.g., pressure-sensitive adhesives and biological and biomimetic surfaces). Achieving both superstrong adhesion and reversibility has been challenging. This task is particularly difficult for hydrogels that, because their major constituent is liquid water, typically do not adhere strongly to any material. Here, we report a snail epiphragm-inspired adhesion mechanism where a polymer gel system demonstrates superglue-like adhesion strength (up to 892 N⋅cm
              −2
              ) that is also reversible. It is applicable to both flat and rough target surfaces. In its hydrated state, the softened gel conformally adapts to the target surface by low-energy deformation, which is locked upon drying as the elastic modulus is raised from hundreds of kilopascals to ∼2.3 GPa, analogous to the action of the epiphragm of snails. We show that in this system adhesion strength is based on the material’s intrinsic, especially near-surface, properties and not on any near-surface structure, providing reversibility and ease of scaling up for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a breakthrough in cancer therapy, a monotherapy approach is not suﬃcient. Here, we report an immune checkpoint inhibitor-modiﬁed nanoparticle for an in situ-assembled tumor vaccine that can activate immune systems in the tumor microenvironment and prevent the long-term recurrence of tumors. Adjuvant-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by entrapping imiquimod (IQ) in photoresponsive polydopamine nanoparticles (IQ/PNs). The surfaces of IQ/PNs were then modiﬁed with anti-PDL1 antibody (PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs) for in situ assembly with inactivated tumor cells and immune checkpoint blocking of PDL1 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1). The presence of anti-PDL1 antibodies on IQ/PNs increased the binding of nanoparticles to CT26 cancer cells overexpressing PDL1. Subsequent near-infrared (NIR) irradiation induced a greater photothermal anticancer eﬀect against cells treated with PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs than cells treated with plain PNs or unmodiﬁed IQ/PNs. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we cocultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with CT26 cells treated with various nanoparticle formulations and NIR irradiated. This coculture study revealed that NIR-inactivated, PDL1Ab-IQ/PN-bound CT26 cells induced maturation of dendritic cells to the greatest extent. Following a single intravenous administration of diﬀerent nanoparticle formulations in CT26 tumor-bearing mice, PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs showed greater tumor tissue accumulation than unmodiﬁed nanoparticles. Subsequent NIR irradiation of mice treated with PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs resulted in tumor ablation. In addition to primary tumor ablation, PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs completely prevented the growth of a secondarily challenged CT26 tumor at a distant site, producing 100\% survival for up to 150 days. A long-term protection study revealed that treatment with PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs followed by NIR irradiation inhibited the growth of distant, secondarily challenged CT26 tumors 150 days after the ﬁrst tumor inoculation. Moreover, increased inﬁltration of T cells was observed in tumor tissues treated with PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs and NIR-irradiated, and T cells isolated from splenocytes of mice in which tumor recurrence was prevented showed active killing of CT26 cells. These results suggest that PDL1Ab-IQ/PNs in conjunction with NIR irradiation induce a potent, in situ-assembled, all-in-one tumor vaccine with adjuvant-containing nanoparticle-bound, inactivated tumor cells. Such in situ nanoadjuvant-assembled tumor vaccines can be further developed for long-term prevention of tumor recurrence without the need for chemotherapy.},

This new strategy for covalent immobilization of proteins or peptides provides an easy and gentle mechanism for biochemical modiﬁcation of hydrogels. Labeling eﬃciency was approximately 100\% when soluble RGDS-SC was applied to SpyTag-containing hydrogels at a 1:1 molar ratio. RGDS-SC remained stably bound throughout the 5 days of rinsing, and 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were able to adhere to PEG gels presenting RGDS-SC, but did not adhere when the scrambled amino acid sequence RDGS was presented instead. Fibroblasts encapsulated within 3D celldegradable PEG hydrogels containing SpyTag did not spread until RGDS-SC was added to the gels, at which point cell spreading was induced.

Motivated by these unsatisfactory properties of existing tissue sealants, herein, we designed a library of solvent- and initiator-free hydrophobic musselinspired degradable tissue adhesives that can stick and seal the epidermis, pericardium, and Glisson’s capsule under physiologically relevant wet conditions. By varying the molar ratio of the functional groups, we obtained polyester adhesive sealants with similar surface energy and varying viscosity. The careful examination of the wetting behavior of these polyester adhesive sealants on tissue surfaces showed that the polyester adhesive sealant with lower viscosity has higher intrinsic work of adhesion, which allowed them to adhere to strongly hydrated surfaces such as pericardium and Glisson’s capsule. Because of the lower intrinsic work of adhesion, the polyester adhesive sealant with higher viscosity only adhered to the relatively hydrophobic surface (epidermis). The strong wet adhesion to tissue surfaces, cell-compatibility, hydrolytic degradability, and radical scavenging nature of these polyester adhesive sealants make them potential candidates for wound closure procedures.},

	abstract = {Objectives  This study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed elastomeric sealant, which does not require any blood coagulation system to exert its effect, during thoracic aortic surgery.
Methods  This is a multicenter, randomized study conducted in six hospitals in Japan. A total of 81 patients undergoing replacement surgery of a thoracic aortic aneurysm using cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized with a ratio of 2–:1 for those patients designated to receive the sealant (Group S, 54 patients) or those without the usage of the sealant (Group C, 27 patients). The primary endpoints were bleeding from each anastomosis at two time points: (1) immediately before applying protamine and (2) 15 min after applying protamine. The patients were followed for 6 months.
Results  The number of anastomoses checked for bleeding was 196 in Group S and 117 in Group C. Before protamine sulfate administration, complete hemostasis was obtained in 155 anastomoses (79\%) in Group S compared to 45 anastomoses (38\%) in Group C (p {\textless} 0.001). Fifteen minutes after the administration of protamine sulfate infusion, bleeding stopped completely in 173 anastomoses (88\%) in Group S and in 71 anastomoses (61\%, p {\textless} 0.001) in Group C. Between the two groups, there were no marked differences in the patient background or in the incidence of major adverse events.
Conclusions  The sealant is effective in achieving hemostasis, even under fully heparinized conditions. The novel sealant is safe and effective in thoracic aortic surgery, one of the most demanding surgical situations for hemostasis.},

These strategies have great potential to achieve repair or replacement of diseased organs by cell- and material-based therapies. However, paradoxically, they might also trigger ﬁbrosis. Cases of TERM interventions with adverse outcome are also included in this review. Furthermore, we emphasize the fact that, although organ engineering is still in its infancy, the advances in the ﬁeld are leading to biomedically relevant in vitro models with tremendous potential for disease recapitulation and development of therapies.

	abstract = {Underlying metabolic disease is poor adipose tissue function characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and low expression of health promoting adipokines. Currently, no treatments speciﬁcally target the adipose tissue and we are investigating polymer scaﬀolds for localized drug delivery as a therapeutic platform. In this work we implanted porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaﬀolds into the epididymal fat of mice. Surprisingly, “empty” scaﬀolds decreased blood glucose levels in healthy mice as well as epididymal fat pad size. By injecting a ﬂuorescent glucose tracer into mice, we determined that glucose uptake increases by 60\% in epididymal fat pads with scaﬀolds; in contrast, glucose uptake was not elevated in other major metabolic organs, suggesting the enhanced glucose uptake at the scaﬀold implant site was responsible for decreased blood glucose levels. Histology indicated increased cellularity and tissue remodeling around the scaﬀold and we found increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1, which are proteins involved in wound healing that can also modulate blood glucose levels through their promotion of glucose uptake. Regarding clinical translation, “empty” scaﬀolds decreased obesity and improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a high fat diet. These ﬁndings demonstrate increased cellular activity in the adipose tissue, such as that associated with the host response to biomaterial implant, is beneﬁcial in mice suﬀering from metabolic complications of over nutrition, possibly because it mitigates the positive energy balance that leads to the obese, diabetic state. More broadly, this work reaﬃrms that in addition to the local host response typically investigated, biomaterial implant has systemic physiological eﬀects and suggests that there may be implications for therapy.},

By providing mechanical support to the ventricular wall, hydrogel injectate may act to preserve cardiac function and slow the remodeling process that leads to heart failure. However, improved outcomes will likely depend on the use of hydrogels specifically designed for this unique application, and better understanding of the mechanisms affected by the intervention. In this work, we present the first large animal study achieving functional and geometrical improvements in treating MI using a relatively stiff, fully synthetic hydrogel designed for intramyocardial injection. In addition, the renin-angiotensin system coincided with the mechanical effects of hydrogel injection and attenuated left ventricular remodeling, even after significant hydrogel degradation had occurred in vivo. These results may inspire further optimization of hydrogel materials used in intramyocardial hydrogel injection therapy and a better description of physiologic pathways affected by its implementation to facilitate successful clinical translation.},

However, so far, no comparative study focusing on effect of charge differences (i.e., positive vs. negative) in the presence of conjugated catechols has been conducted. In this study, we investigate the physicochemical characteristics and in vitro/in vivo tissue adhesive properties of hydrogels that use anionic (i.e., hyaluronic acid) and cationic (i.e. chitosan) catechol-conjugated polysaccharides. Fe(III) is utilized to effectively prepare both hydrogels. Hyaluronic acid-catechol (HA-C) hydrogels are immediately formed by iron-catechol coordination bonds, while chitosan-catechol (CHI-C) hydrogel is formed by both iron-catechol coordination and catechol-amine covalent reactions. The gelation time and in vitro adhesiveness are similar for both CHI-C and HA-C hydrogels. Differences are found in that the CHI-C hydrogels showed enhanced water-resistance and long-lasting adhesion in vivo. It is noteworthy to mention that the cationic nature of mussel adhesive proteins due to lysine and histidine residues in the pads of Mytilus edulis is known to be an important contributor to underwater adhesion. Thus, this comparative study provides signiﬁcant insight for the design of effective mussel-inspired adhesive materials.},

Grafts rapidly recovered their precompressed shape, stiffening and swelling upon warm saline rinse to result in 100\% stable graft fixation. The osteoconductive macroporous grafts guided bone formation throughout the defect as early as 4 weeks after implantation; new bone remodeling correlated with rates of scaffold composition-dependent degradation. A single dose of 400-ng recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2/7 heterodimer delivered via the graft accelerated bone regeneration bridging throughout the entire defect by 4 weeks after delivery.

The gene silencing efficiency of a stored lyophilized siRNA formulation (i.e. siRNA nanosomes) was evaluated in interferon-α (IFN-α) resistant hepatitis C virus (HCV) at different time points up to three months in an in vitro cell culture model and compared with freshly prepared siRNA formulations. Novel siRNA sequences were encapsulated within nanosize liposomes following condensation with protamine sulfate. The siRNA encapsulated nanosomes were lyophilized and stored at 4°C for 3 months, along with liquid liposomes (L) and lyophilized liposome powder (P) which were subsequently used to prepare siRNA nanosomes (L) and siRNA nanosomes (P), respectively at different time points. Physiochemical and biological properties of all three formulations were compared at different time points up to 3 months. The particle size of the stored siRNA nanosomes (642±25 nm) was considerably larger initially in comparison with the liquid liposomes (134±5 nm) and lyophilized liposomes (118±3). However, the particle size gradually became smaller over time (413±128 nm by the third month). The zeta potential of all three formulations was initially very high ({\textgreater} +40 mV), followed by a gradual decrease over time. The amount of siRNA in the stored siRNA nanosomes decreased {\textasciitilde} 18\% during the 3 month storage period (1.16±0.03 nmol initially on day 1 vs. 0.95±0.04 nmol after 3 months). With respect to biological potency, all three formulations were significantly effective to knock-down HCV throughout the storage time. The cell viability was well-maintained throughout this period. Thus, this study indicates that the stored lyophilized siRNA formulation is as effective as the fresh preparation and that long-term storage could be a viable option to treat deadly diseases such as cancer and viral infection.},

The lipoplexes when lyophilized in the presence of sugars as lyoprotectants could be lyophilized and reconstituted without loss of transfection efficacy but in ionic solutions they lost 65–75\% of their functionality. The mechanism of this loss of activity was further investigated. The lyophilization process did not alter siRNA’s intrinsic biological activity as was evident by the ability of lyophilized siRNA to retain functionality and SYBR green I binding ability. While the lipoplex size dramatically increased (∼50–70 times) after lyophilization in the absence of non-ionic lyoprotectants. This increase in size correlated to the decrease in cellular accumulation of siRNA and a decrease in activity. In conclusion, siRNAs can be applied in cationic lipid lyophilized formulations and these complexes represent a potential method of increasing the stability of pre-formed complex.},

To be efﬁcacious and widely accepted by physicians and patients, therapeutic siRNAs must access the viable skin layers in a stable and functional form, preferably without painful administration. In this study we explore the use of minimally-invasive steel microneedle devices to effectively deliver siRNA into skin. A simple, yet precise microneedle coating method permitted reproducible loading of siRNA onto individual microneedles. Following recovery from the microneedle surface, lamin A/C siRNA retained full activity, as demonstrated by signiﬁcant reduction in lamin A/C mRNA levels and reduced lamin A/C protein in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. However, lamin A/C siRNA pre-complexed with a commercial lipid-based transfection reagent (siRNA lipoplex) was less functional following microneedle coating. As Accell-modiﬁed “self-delivery” siRNA targeted against CD44 also retained functionality after microneedle coating, this form of siRNA was used in subsequent in vivo studies, where gene silencing was determined in a transgenic reporter mouse skin model. Self-delivery siRNA targeting the reporter (luciferase/GFP) gene was coated onto microneedles and delivered to mouse footpad. Quantiﬁcation of reporter mRNA and intravital imaging of reporter expression in the outer skin layers conﬁrmed functional in vivo gene silencing following microneedle delivery of siRNA. The use of coated metal microneedles represents a new, simple, minimally-invasive, patient-friendly and potentially self-administrable method for the delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to the skin.},

          , 
            Cationic polymers are promising delivery systems for RNAi due to their ease of manipulation, scale-up conditions and transfection efficiency. However, some properties, such as stability and targeting, remain challenging to overcome. In this report, different modifications in poly(β-amino ester) (pBAE) structures have been explored to overcome these limitations. Recent studies have demonstrated that hydrophobicity plays a key role in controlling electrostatic interactions of plasma proteins with nanoparticles. Results show that a slight increase in the polymer hydrophobicity increases its siRNA packaging capacity, stability, and transfection efficiency. Consequently, polyplexes prepared with these hydrophobic structures are functional after incubation times longer than 48 hours in serum-containing medium. In addition, newly designed polymers were end-modified using different oligopeptide moieties in order to confer cell-specificity, as previously reported. Therefore, it can be concluded that these newly optimized pBAE polymers present great potential as delivery vectors to specifically drive therapeutic RNA-based nucleic acids in a cell-specific manner under physiological conditions.},

Here, we evaluated an array of synthetic end-modiﬁed poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE)-based nanoparticles to optimize siRNA delivery into hMSCs. In general, cystamineterminated polymers caused the most knockdown, with the best polymer achieving 91\% knockdown 20 days post-transfection. Binding studies revealed that the cystamine-terminated polymer bound siRNA tightly at lower weight ratios of polymer to siRNA but then efﬁciently released siRNA upon exposure to a reducing environment, suggesting that this class of PBAEs can form tight initial interactions with its cargo and then cause efﬁcient, environmentally-triggered release in the cytoplasm. Finally, we tested a functional application of this system by transfecting hMSCs with siRNA against an inhibitor of osteogenesis, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-like protein 2 (BCL2L2). This resulted in enhanced osteogenesis over 4 weeks as evidenced by Alizarin Red S staining and calcium quantiﬁcation. The bioreducible PBAE/siRNA nanoparticles developed here can provide a means of safe and effective control of hMSC differentiation for a wide variety of applications.},

To improve reproducibility and efficacy of transfections in vitro using a next-generation polyplex transfection material poly(beta-amino ester)s (PBAEs), the influence of multiple variables in the preparation of these nanoparticles on their transfection efficacy was explored. The results indicate that the even though PBAE/pDNA polyplex nanoparticles are formed by self-assembly of polyelectrolytes, their transfection is not affected by the manner in which the components are mixed, facilitating self-assembly in a single step, but a timing for self-assembly of 5-20 min is optimal. In addition, even though the biomaterials are biodegradable in water, their efficacy is not affected by up to 8 freeze-thaw cycles of the polymer. It was found that there is greater stability of nucleic acid-complexed polymer as a polyplex nanoparticle compared to free polymer. Finally, by exploring multiple buffer systems, it was identified that utilization of divalent cation magnesium or calcium acetate buffers at pH 5.0 are optimal for transfection using these polymeric materials, boosting transfection several fold compared to monovalent cations. Together, these results can improve the reproducibility and efficacy of PBAE and similar polyplex nanoparticle transfections and improve the robustness of using these biomaterials for bioengineering and biotechnology applications.},

	abstract = {Background Small interfering (si)RNA mediated inhibition of oncogenes or viral genes may offer great opportunities for the treatment of several diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and viral hepatitis. However, the development of siRNAs as therapeutic agents strongly depends on the availability of safe and effective intracellular delivery systems. Poly(β-amino esters) (PbAEs) are, in contrast to many other cationic polymers evaluated in siRNA delivery, biodegradable into smaller, nontoxic molecules.
Methods and Results We show for the ﬁrst time that PbAE : siRNA complexes, containing 1,4-butanediol (PbAE1) or 1,6-hexanediol (PbAE2) diacrylate-based polymers, induced efﬁcient gene silencing in both hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes without causing signiﬁcant cytotoxicity. Furthermore, carriers that slowly release the siRNA into the cytoplasm and hence induce a prolonged gene silencing are of major clinical interest, especially in fast dividing tumour cells. Therefore, we also studied the duration of gene silencing in the hepatoma cells and found that it was maintained for at least 5 days after siRNA delivery with PbAE2, the polymer with the slowest degradation kinetics.
Conclusions From the time-dependent cellular distribution of these PbAE : siRNA complexes, we suggest that the slowly degrading PbAE2 causes a sustained endosomal release of siRNA during a much longer period than PbAE1. This may support the hypothesis that the endosomal release mechanism of PbAE : siRNA complexes is based on an increase of osmotic pressure in the endosomal vesicles after polymer hydrolysis. In conclusion, our results show that both PbAEs, and especially PbAE2, open up new perspectives for the development of efﬁcient biodegradable siRNA carriers suitable for clinical applications.

Here, we separately examine the mass transport of polymer molecules and extrinsic sitescharged polyelectrolyte repeat units balanced by counterionswithin thin ﬁlms of polyelectrolyte complex, PEC, using sensitive isotopic labeling techniques. The apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients of these sites within PEC ﬁlms of poly(diallyldimethylammonium), PDADMA, and poly(styrenesulfonate), PSS, are at least 2 orders of magnitude faster than the diﬀusion of polyelectrolytes themselves. This is because site diﬀusion requires only local rearrangements of polyelectrolyte repeat units, placing far fewer kinetic limitations on the assembly of polyelectrolyte complexes in all of their forms. Site diﬀusion strongly depends on the salt concentration (ionic strength) of the environment, and diﬀusion of PDADMA sites is faster than that of PSS sites, accounting for the asymmetric nature of multilayer growth. Site diﬀusion is responsible for multilayer growth in the linear and into the exponential regimes, which explains how PDADMA can mysteriously “pass through” layers of PSS. Using quantitative relationships between site diﬀusion coeﬃcient and salt concentration, conditions were identiﬁed that allowed the diﬀusion length to always exceed the ﬁlm thickness, leading to full exponential growth over 3 orders of magnitude thickness. Both site and polymer diﬀusion were independent of molecular weight, suggesting that ion pairing density is a limiting factor. Polyelectrolyte complexes are examples of a broader class of dynamic bulk polymeric materials that (self-) assemble via the transport of crosslinks or defects rather than actual molecules.},

The in vivo effects of PLGA MP dose and siRNA–PEI polyplex delivery were examined via non-invasive meal pattern analysis and by quantifying the protein level of the siRNA target as well as of several downstream inﬂammatory cytokines. Controlled release of siRNA–PEI from PLGA MPs signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂammation-induced changes in meal patterns compared to untreated rats with inﬂamed TMJs. These changes correlated to decreases in tissue-level protein expression of the siRNA target to 20–50\% of the amount present in the corresponding control groups. Similar reductions were also observed in the expression of downstream inﬂammatory cytokines, e.g. interleukin-6, whose tissue levels in the siRNA–PEI PLGA MP groups were 50\% of the values for the corresponding controls. This intra-articular sustained release system has signiﬁcant implications for the treatment of severe TMJ pain, and also has the potential to be readily adapted and applied to mitigate painful, chronic inﬂammation in a variety of conditions.},

The ability of siRNAs to inhibit gene expression offers a mechanism that can be exploited for novel therapeutics. Indeed, over the past decade, at least 21 siRNA therapeutics have been developed for more than a dozen diseases, including various cancers, viruses, and genetic disorders. Like other biological drugs, RNAi-based therapeutics often require a delivery vehicle to transport them to the targeted cells. Thus, the clinical advancement of numerous siRNA drugs has relied on the development of siRNA carriers, including biodegradable nanoparticles, lipids, bacteria, and attenuated viruses. Most therapies permit systemic delivery of the siRNA drug, while others use ex vivo delivery by autologous cell therapy. Advancements in bioengineering and nanotechnology have led to improved control of delivery and release of some siRNA therapeutics. Likewise, progress in molecular biology has allowed for improved design of the siRNA molecules. Here, we provide an overview of siRNA therapeutics in clinical trials, including their clinical progress, the challenges they have encountered, and the future they hold in the treatment of human diseases.},

	abstract = {Despite efforts to understand the interactions between nanoparticles and cells, the cellular processes that determine the efficiency of intracellular drug delivery remain unclear. Here we examine cellular uptake of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) using cellular trafficking probes in combination with automated high-throughput confocal microscopy. We also employed defined perturbations of cellular pathways paired with systems biology approaches to uncover protein-protein and protein–small molecule interactions. We show that multiple cell signaling effectors are required for initial cellular entry of LNPs through macropinocytosis, including proton pumps, mTOR and cathepsins. siRNA delivery is substantially reduced as ≅70\% of the internalized siRNA undergoes exocytosis through egress of LNPs from late endosomes/lysosomes. Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) is shown to be an important regulator of the major recycling pathways of LNP-delivered siRNAs. NPC1-deficient cells show enhanced cellular retention of LNPs inside late endosomes and lysosomes, and increased gene silencing of the target gene. Our data suggest that siRNA delivery efficiency might be improved by designing delivery vehicles that can escape the recycling pathways.},

Here we report the use of the Amaxa® Nucleofector® 96-well Shuttle® System for siRNA screening in primary cells. Lonza's Clonetics® HUVEC-Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were transfected with Thermo Scientific Dharmacon siGENOME® siRNA Libraries targeting protein kinases and cell cycle related genes and screened for genes important for cell viability. Of the 37 primary hits, down-regulation of 33 led to reduced proliferation or increased cell death, while down-regulation of two allowed for better cell viability. The validated four genes out of the 16 strongest primary hits (COPB2, PYCS, CDK4 and MYC) influenced cell proliferation to varying degrees, reflecting differing importance for survival of HUVEC cells. Our results demonstrate that the Nucleofector® 96-well Shuttle® System allows the delivery of siRNA libraries in cell types previously considered to be difficult to transfect. Thus, identification and validation of gene targets can now be conducted in primary cells, as the selection of cell types is not limited to those accessible by lipid-mediated transfection.},

Although polyionic condensation of nucleic acids with polycations has been widely used for gene delivery, siRNA is not strongly associated with cationic carriers due to its low charge density and rigid molecular structures. The use of an excess amount of cationic carriers is often used for siRNA condensation, though they can induce severe cytotoxicity. Here we introduce the self-assembly of siRNA with mild polyelectrolytes into multilayers for efficient gene silencing during cell proliferation. The multilayers were prepared through the sequential layer-by-layer deposition of siRNA and poly-L-lysine (PLL) on a polydopamine-coated substrate. The cells, grown on the siRNA/PLL multilayers, exhibited a remarkable inhibition of the expression of target genes as compared to the use of scrambled siRNA. The gene silencing efficiency depends on the number of siRNA layers within a multilayer. This result indicates that siRNA/PLL multilayers can be potentially utilized for efficient surface-mediated siRNA delivery.},

Most exciting is their ability to encapsulate multiple functional elements, which allow nanocarriers to deliver complex combination therapies with staged release. However, relative to planar LbL constructs, colloidal LbL systems have not undergone extensive systematic studies that outline critical synthetic solution conditions needed for robust and efficient assembly. The multistaged process of adsorbing a series of materials onto a nanoscopic template is inherently complex, and facilitating the self-assembly of these materials depends on identifying proper solution conditions for each synthetic step and adsorbed material. Here, we focus on addressing some of the fundamental questions that must be answered in order to obtain a reliable and robust synthesis of nucleic acid-containing LbL liposomes. This includes a study of solution conditions, such as pH, ionic strength, salt composition, and valency, and their impact on the preparation of LbL nanoparticles. Our results provide insight into the selection of solution conditions to control the degree of ionization and the electrostatic screening length to suit the adsorption of nucleic acids and synthetic polypeptides. The optimization of these parameters led to a roughly 8-fold improvement in nucleic acid loading in LbL liposomes, indicating the importance of optimizing solution conditions in the preparation of therapeutic LbL nanoparticles. These results highlight the benefits of defining principles for constructing highly effective nanoparticle systems.},

	abstract = {Because of RNA's ability to encode structure and functional information, researchers have fabricated diverse geometric structures from this polymer at the micro- and nanoscale. With their tunable structures, rigidity, and biocompatibility, novel two-dimensional and three-dimensional RNA structures can serve as a fundamental platform for biomedical applications, including engineered tissues, biosensors, and drug delivery vehicles. The discovery of the potential of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) has underscored the applications of RNA-based micro- and nanostructures in medicine.Small-interfering RNA (siRNA), synthetic double-stranded RNA consisting of approximately 21 base pairs, suppresses problematic target genes in a sequence-specific manner via inherent RNA interference (RNAi) processing. As a result, siRNA offers a potential strategy for treatment of many human diseases. However, due to inefficient delivery to cells and off-target effects, the clinical application of therapeutic siRNA has been very challenging. To address these issues, researchers have studied a variety of nanocarrier systems for siRNA delivery.In this Account, we describe several strategies for efficient siRNA delivery and selective gene silencing. We took advantage of facile chemical conjugation and complementary hybridization to design novel siRNA-based micro- and nanostructures. Using chemical crosslinkers and hydrophobic/hydrophilic polymers at the end of siRNA, we produced various RNA-based structures, including siRNA block copolymers, micelles, linear siRNA homopolymers, and microhydrogels. Because of their increased charge density and flexibility compared with conventional siRNA, these micro- and nanostructures can form polyelectrolyte complexes with poorly charged and biocompatible cationic carriers that are both more condensed and more homogenous than the complexes formed in other carrier systems. In addition, the fabricated siRNA-based structures are linked by cleavable disulfide bonds for facile generation of original siRNA in the cytosol and for target-specific gene silencing. These newly developed siRNA-based structures greatly enhance intracellular uptake and gene silencing both in vitro and in vivo, making them promising biomaterials for siRNA therapeutics.},

Here, we introduce a rapid (∼30 min per batch, eight layers), scalable (up to 500 mg of templates), and efficient (98\% yield) microcapsule preparation technique utilizing a fluidized bed for the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of polymers, and we investigate the parameters that govern the formation of robust capsules. Fluidization in water was possible for particles of comparable diameter to mammalian cells ({\textgreater}5 μm), with the experimental flow rates necessary for fluidization matching well with the theoretical values. Important variables for polymer film deposition and capsule formation were the concentration of polymer solution and the molecular weight of the polymer, while the volume of the polymer solution had a negligible impact. In combination, increasing the polymer molecular weight and polymer solution concentration resulted in improved film deposition and the formation of robust microcapsules. The resultant polymer microcapsules had a thickness of ∼5.5 nm per bilayer, which is in close agreement with conventionally prepared (quiescent (nonflow) adsorption/centrifugation/wash) LbL capsules. The technique reported herein provides a new way to rapidly generate microcapsules (approximately 8 times quicker than the conventional means), while being also amenable to scale-up and mass production.},

While centrifugation-based LbL assembly is the most common method for coating template particles and preparing capsules, it is a batch process and requires frequent intervention that renders the system challenging to automate and scale up. Here, we report the use of a tapered fluidized bed (TFB) for the preparation of multilayered polymer capsules. This is a significant improvement over our recent approach of fluidizing particles in cylindrical fluidized beds (CFB) for LbL assembly. We demonstrate that TFB is compatible with particles {\textless}3 μm in diameter (an order-of-magnitude improvement compared with CFB), which can be fluidized with minimal entrainment. Additionally, layering materials were expanded to include both electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding polymer pairs (e.g., poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), and thiol-modified poly(methacrylic acid) (PMASH) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPON), respectively). Finally, differences between capsules prepared via centrifugation-based and TFB LbL assembly were investigated. The obtained TFB microcapsules demonstrate increased film thickness and roughness compared with those prepared using centrifugation-based LbL assembly. Furthermore, PMASH microcapsules exhibit lower swelling and permeability when prepared via TFB LbL assembly compared with centrifugation-based LbL assembly due to enhanced multilayer deposition, entanglement, and cross-linking. Therefore, polymeric capsules fabricated via TFB LbL assembly may be useful for encapsulation and retention of relatively low molecular weight (∼20 kDa) hydrophilic biomacromolecules to passively or responsively release the payload for drug delivery applications.},

Over the last half-century, the layer-by-layer assembly of nanoscale films has received intense and growing interest. This has been fueled by innovation in the available materials and assembly technologies, as well as the film-characterization techniques. In this Review, we explore, discuss, and detail innovation in layer-by-layer assembly in terms of past and present developments, and we highlight how these might guide future advances. A particular focus is on conventional and early developments that have only recently regained interest in the layer-by-layer assembly field. We then review unconventional assemblies and approaches that have been gaining popularity, which include inorganic/organic hybrid materials, cells and tissues, and the use of stereocomplexation, patterning, and dip-pen lithography, to name a few. A relatively recent development is the use of layer-by-layer assembly materials and techniques to assemble films in a single continuous step. We name this “quasi”-layer-by-layer assembly and discuss the impacts and innovations surrounding this approach. Finally, the application of characterization methods to monitor and evaluate layer-by-layer assembly is discussed, as innovation in this area is often overlooked but is essential for development of the field. While we intend for this Review to be easily accessible and act as a guide to researchers new to layer-by-layer assembly, we also believe it will provide insight to current researchers in the field and help guide future developments and innovation.},

When functionalized with targeting ligands, these particles have the potential to interact with specific cells and tissues, and accumulate at desired target sites, reducing side effects and improve overall efficacy in applications such as vaccination and drug delivery. However, when targeted particles enter a complex biological environment, the adsorption of biomolecules and the formation of a surface coating (e.g., a protein corona) changes the properties of the carriers and can render their behavior unpredictable. For this reason, it is of importance to consider the potential challenges imposed by the biological environment at the early stages of particle design. This review describes parameters that affect the targeting ability of particulate drug carriers, with an emphasis on the effect of the protein corona. We highlight strategies for exploiting the protein corona to improve the targeting ability of particles. Finally, we provide suggestions for complementing current in vitro assays used for the evaluation of targeting and carrier efficacy with new and emerging techniques (e.g., 3D models and flow-based technologies) to advance fundamental understanding in bio-nano science and to accelerate the development of targeted particles for biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {A highly efficient approach for target-specific gene silencing based on a reductively dissociable nanogel incorporating small interfering RNA (siRNA) crosslinked with linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) via disulfide bonds is presented. Thiol-terminated siRNA at both 3′-ends is electrostatically complexed with thiol-grafted LPEI. The prepared siRNA/LPEI complex contains inter- and intramolecular linkages, generating a mutually crosslinked siRNA/LPEI nanogel (MCN) that exhibits excellent structural stability against the addition of heparin but is readily disintegrated to biologically active, monomeric siRNA upon exposure to reductive conditions. Accordingly, the highly condensed, stable MCN shows greatly enhanced cellular uptake and gene silencing efficiency compared to the siRNA/LPEI complexes without crosslinks or with only LPEI-mediated crosslinks.},

	abstract = {Chemoreduction is currently the most popular treatment strategy for intraocular retinoblastoma worldwide. Despite the dramatic clinical responses obtained with multiagent systemic chemotherapy regimens, enthusiasm for this treatment approach has been tempered by the potential toxicities of these drugs in the pediatric population. As a response to these concerns, novel approaches for the local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to ocular structures have been investigated by both clinicians and scientists. Ocular oncologists have developed the periocular injection of carboplatin as a method for controlling intraocular tumor growth of retinoblastoma while minimizing systemic drug exposure. In parallel, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced drug-delivery systems to the posterior segment of the globe for a variety of ocular diseases. One example of the collaborative work by ophthalmologists and biopharmaceutical scientists is the use of fibrin sealants as a targeted drug-administration device, formulated to deliver sustained concentrations of chemotherapy at the site of application. This review integrates the recent ophthalmology and pharmaceutics literature on the potential role of fibrin sealants for periocular chemotherapy administration in the treatment of retinoblastoma.},

The in situ formation of MOF–drug composites demonstrates high drug loading capacity compared to conventional methods. The present methodology is devoid of any extra steps for loading the drug after synthesis. Moreover, the drug loading is also independent of pore size of the MOF as the drug molecules are embedded inside the MOF during their in situ formation. The drug release was monitored under external stimuli including change to acidic pH and the presence of biocompatible liposomes for a period of more than 72 h. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy is used to monitor the drug release as a function of time and confocal laser scanning microscopy is used to unravel the post-release fate of doxorubicin in the presence of liposomes. It is found that drug release rate is higher for the Zn–BTC–dox composite than for the Fe–BTC–dox composite. This is attributed to the stronger binding between dox and Fe-BTC than that between dox and Zn–BTC. This study highlights a novel approach for the preparation of MOF–drug composites in an aqueous medium for future biomedical applications.},

The hyperbranched glycidyl methacrylate-co-poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate polymers (HB-GMA-PEGs) were first synthesized via in situ deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (DE-ATRP). A series of pre-cross-linked materials were achieved after postfunctionalization. The material can absorb a high amount of water to form hydrogels, and the gel stiffness was evaluated in detail before and after UV irradiation. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments were conducted with the resulting materials and have demonstrated their good biocompatibility. The results indicate that this type of hydrogel with high water uptake capacity has appealing potential as a responsive biomaterial for wound closure.},

	abstract = {During the resorbable-polymer-boom of the 1970s and 1980s, polycaprolactone (PCL) was used extensively in the biomaterials field and a number of drug-delivery devices. Its popularity was soon superseded by faster resorbable polymers which had fewer perceived disadvantages associated with long-term degradation (up to 3–4 years) and intracellular resorption pathways; consequently, PCL was almost forgotten for most of two decades. Recently, a resurgence of interest has propelled PCL back into the biomaterials-arena. The superior rheological and viscoelastic properties over many of its aliphatic polyester counterparts renders PCL easy to manufacture and manipulate into a large range of implants and devices. Coupled with relatively inexpensive production routes and FDA approval, this provides a promising platform for the design and fabrication of longer term degradable implants which may be manipulated physically, chemically and biologically to possess tailorable degradation kinetics to suit a specific anatomical site. This review will discuss the application of PCL as a biomaterial over the last two decades focusing on the advantages which have propagated its return into the spotlight with a particular focus on medical devices, drug delivery and tissue engineering.},

Tritium-labeled PCL (Mw 3000) was subcutaneous implanted in rats to investigate its absorption and excretion. The radioactive tracer was first detected in plasma 15 days after implantation. At the same time radioactive excreta was recovered from feces and urine. An accumulative 92\% of the implanted radioactive tracer was excreted from feces and urine by 135 days after implantation.

Human colon cancer cells (Caco-2) were permanently transfected with a COX-2 expression vector or the identical vector lacking the COX-2 insert. The Caco-2 cells, which constitutively expressed COX-2, acquired increased invasiveness compared with the parental Caco-2 cells or the vector transfected control cells. Biochemical changes associated with this phenotypic change included activation of metalloproteinase-2 and increased RNA levels for the membrane-type metalloproteinase. Increased invasiveness and prostaglandin production were reversed by treatment with sulindac sulfide, a known COX inhibitor. These studies demonstrate that constitutive expression of COX-2 can lead to phenotypic changes that alter the metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells.COX,cyclooxygenase;NSAID,nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug;MMP-2,metalloproteinase-2;MT MMP,membrane-type metalloproteinase;PGE2,prostaglandin E2;TIMP,tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In a previous study of treatment for advanced colorectal cancer, the LV5FU2 regimen, comprising leucovorin (LV) plus bolus and infusional fluorouracil (5FU) every 2 weeks, was superior to the standard North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Mayo Clinic 5-day bolus 5FU/LV regimen. This phase III study investigated the effect of combining oxaliplatin with LV5FU2, with progression-free survival as the primary end point. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty previously untreated patients with measurable disease were randomized to receive a 2-hour infusion of LV (200 mg/m2/d) followed by a 5FU bolus (400 mg/m2/d) and 22-hour infusion (600 mg/m2/d) for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks, either alone or together with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. RESULTS: Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P = .0003) and better response rate (50.7\% v 22.3\%; P = .0001) when compared with the control arm. The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P = .12). LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41.7\% v 5.3\% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9\% v 5.3\%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2\% v 0\%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL). Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P = .004). CONCLUSION: The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.},

The application of nanotechnology is expected to achieve coencapsulation of multiple anticancer agents with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a unique nanomicelle based on amphiphilic dendrimer (AmD) consisting of a hydrophilic polyamidoamine dendritic shell and a hydrophobic polylactide core is developed for effectively loading and shuttling 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and doxorubicin (Dox). The yielded drug-encapsulated dendritic nanomicelle (5-Fu/Dox-DNM) has a modest average size of 68.6 ± 3.3 nm and shows pH-sensitive drug release manner. The parallel activity of 5-Fu and Dox show synergistic anticancer efficacy. The IC50 value of 5-Fu/Dox-DNM toward human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells was 0.25 μg/mL, presenting an 11.2-fold and 6.1-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to Dox-DNM and 5-Fu-DNM, respectively. Furthermore, 5-Fu/Dox-DNM significantly inhibits the progression of tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor mice model. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that our AmD-based combination therapeutic system has promising potential to open an avenue for coencapsulation of multiple chemotherapeutic agents to promote superior anticancer effect.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Although early reports on laparoscopy-assisted colectomy (LAC) in patients with colon cancer suggested that it reduces perioperative morbidity, its influence on long-term results is unknown. Our study aimed to compare efficacy of LAC and open colectomy (OC) for treatment of non-metastatic colon cancer in terms of tumour recurrence and survival.
Methods
From November, 1993, to July, 1998, all patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon were assessed for entry in this randomised trial. Adjuvant therapy and postoperative follow-up were the same in both groups. The main endpoint was cancer-related survival. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Findings
219 patients took part in the study (111 LAC group, 108 OC group). Patients in the LAC group recovered faster than those in the OC group, with shorter peristalsis-detection (p=0·001) and oral-intake times (p=0·001), and shorter hospital stays (p=0·005). Morbidity was lower in the LAC group (p=0·001), although LAC did not influence perioperative mortality. Probability of cancer-related survival was higher in the LAC group (p=0·02). The Cox model showed that LAC was independently associated with reduced risk of tumour relapse (hazard ratio 0·39, 95\% CI 0·19–0·82), death from any cause (0·48, 0·23–1·01), and death from a cancer-related cause (0·38, 0·16–0·91) compared with OC. This superiority of LAC was due to differences in patients with stage III tumours (p=0·04, p=0·02, and p=0·006, respectively).
Interpretation
LAC is more effective than OC for treatment of colon cancer in terms of morbidity, hospital stay, tumour recurrence, and cancer-related survival.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Irinotecan is a drug of the camptothecin family that has proven activity in advanced colon cancer, with about 20\% responses in untreated as well as in 5-fluorouracil-resistant tumors. Irinotecan is considered as a prodrug which needs to be activated to SN-38 by carboxylesterases to become able to interact with its target, topoisomerase I. The work reported here intended to identify the determinants of the cytotoxicity of irinotecan in two human colorectal tumor cell lines, LoVo and HT-29, at the level of the target of the drug and at the level of the availability of the active metabolite to the target.
RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of irinotecan and SN-38 markedly differed in the two cell lines: irinotecan IC(50) values were 15.8 microM for LoVo cells and 5.17 microM for HT-29 cells; SN-38 IC(50) values were 8.25 n M for LoVo cells and 4.50 n M for HT-29 cells. Topoisomerase I expression (at the mRNA and the protein levels) and catalytic activity were similar in the two cell lines. Irinotecan induced similar amounts of cleavable complexes at its IC(50) in both cell lines. SN-38 induced a concentration-dependent formation of cleavable complexes, which was not significantly different in the two cell lines. Expression of the carboxylesterase CES1 was higher in HT-29 than in LoVo cells. Expression of the carboxylesterase gene CES2 was comparable in the two cell lines and much higher than CES1 gene expression. Carboxylesterase activity was extremely low using p-nitrophenylacetate as a substrate (1.45 and 1.84 pmol/min per mg proteins) and could not even be detected using irinotecan as a substrate. Cell accumulation of irinotecan was markedly different, reaching consistently higher levels in HT-29 cells than in LoVo cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that (1) the cytotoxicity of irinotecan was likely due to the drug itself and not to its metabolite SN-38, and (2) that irinotecan uptake was more predictive of its cytotoxicity than topoisomerase I availability and activity in these two cell lines.},

	abstract = {The in vitro cytotoxicity, protein binding, partitioning of platinum from whole blood into erythrocytes, its exchange back into plasma, and the in vitro biotransformation in plasma were studied for the new nonnephrotoxic platinum analogue oxaliplatin. The cytotoxicity studies were carried out against a panel of human tumor cell lines derived from carcinomas of the ovary (A2780, A2780/cp), bladder (TCCSUP, RT4), colon (HT-29), melanoma (SKMEL-2, HTB144), and glioma (U373MG and U87MG). The relative potency of the five platinum complexes was oxaliplatin = tetraplatin {\textgreater} cisplatin {\textgreater} iproplatin {\textgreater} carboplatin. Oxaliplatin was active against HT-29 and only minimally cross-resistant with cisplatin against A2780/cp. Both bladder carcinoma cell lines, both melanoma cell lines, and one of the two glioblastoma cell lines were resistant to both oxaliplatin and tetraplatin. The cytotoxicity profiles of the drug pairs oxaliplatin-tetraplatin and cisplatin-carboplatin showed statistically significant correlation by the Spearman rank correlation test. Oxaliplatin was similar to cisplatin and tetraplatin in protein binding; 85-88\% of all platinum from oxaliplatin (5, 10, or 20 micrograms/ml) was bound to plasma proteins within the first 5 h with an average half-life of 1.71 +/- 0.06 h. When oxaliplatin was incubated in whole blood (5, 10, and 20 micrograms/ml), the erythrocytes took up 37.1 +/- 2.1\% of the total platinum in 2 h (maximum uptake) which was not exchangeable into plasma. Thus the erythrocyte-bound fraction does not serve as a reservoir of drug. In plasma, oxaliplatin was unchanged at 0.5 h, but at 1 h, 30\% of the total platinum in plasma was in a peak which had identical retention to that of (trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)dichloroplatinum(II), the major biotransformation product of tetraplatin. At 2 h, (trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)dichloroplatinum(II) and three other platinum-containing peaks were detected but no unchanged oxaliplatin. All the platinum eluted in a single peak near the solvent front at 4 h. The marked similarity in cytotoxicity between oxaliplatin and tetraplatin may be due to the formation of (trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)dichloroplatinum(II) in tissue culture media.},

	abstract = {IL-15 has potential as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment because it is a critical factor for the proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells. Administration of anti-CD40 antibodies has shown anti-tumor effects in vivo through a variety of mechanisms. Furthermore, activation of CD40 led to increased expression of IL-15 receptor-alpha by dendritic cells, an action that is critical for trans-presentation of IL-15 to NK and CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the combination regimen of murine IL-15 (mIL-15) with an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (FGK4.5) in murine lung metastasis models involving CT26 and MC38, which are murine colon cancer cell lines syngeneic to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Treatment with mIL-15 or the anti-CD40 antibody alone significantly prolonged survival of both CT26 and MC38 tumor-bearing mice compared with the mice in the PBS solution control group (P {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, combination therapy with both mIL-15 and the anti-CD40 antibody provided greater therapeutic efficacy as demonstrated by prolonged survival of the mice compared with either mIL-15 or the anti-CD40 antibody-alone groups (P {\textless} 0.001). We found that NK cells isolated from the mice that received the combination regimen expressed increased levels of intracellular granzyme B and showed stronger cytotoxic activity on the target cells. The findings from this study provide the scientific basis for clinical trials using the combination regimen of IL-15 with an anti-CD40 antibody for the treatment of patients with cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. METHODS Incidence data were obtained from the CDC-funded and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicity were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rectum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. RESULTS Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2014 decreased by 2.2\% per year among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015 decreased by 1.8\% per year among men and by 1.4\% per year among women. Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-year period (2010-2014) decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015) decreased for 11 of the 18 most common types. Among women, incidence rates declined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14 of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, including lung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal (men and women), female breast, and prostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women); pancreas (men and women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oral cavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men only); nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higher among men than among women for all racial and ethnic groups. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared with other racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher incidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-year survival for cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013 ranged from 100\% (stage I) to 26.5\% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1\% (stage I) to 12.6\% (stage IV) for colorectal cancer, from 55.1\% (stage I) to 4.2\% (stage IV) for lung and bronchus cancer, and from 99.5\% (stage I) to 16\% (stage IV) for melanoma of the skin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8\% per year from 2010 to 2014, and overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.5\% per year from 2011 to 2015. CONCLUSIONS For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreased among men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates among both men and women. Differences in rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality has not occurred for all sites. Examining stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage highlights the potential benefits associated with early detection and treatment. Cancer 2018;124:2785-2800. © 2018 American Cancer Society},

	abstract = {Peritoneal spread of tumors is a major problem in cancer management. Patients develop a marked deterioration in quality of life and shortened survival. This is in part due to bowel obstructions, marked ascites, and overall increase debilitation. Standard medical management has shown to be inadequate for the treatment of these problems. Surgery can palliate symptoms, however, it is unable to be complete at the microscopic level by a significant spillage of tumor cells throughout the abdomen. Chemotherapy can have some improvement in symptoms however it is short lived due to poor penetration into the peritoneal cavity. The role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy is to maximize tumor penetration and optimize cell death while minimizing systemic toxicity. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and early post-operative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) are two treatment methods that serve this role and have been shown to improve survival. This review will discuss different chemotherapies used for both of these treatment options.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the impact of anastomotic leak (AL) on disease recurrence and long-term mortality in patients alive 120 days after curative resection for colonic cancer.
        Background: There is no solid data as to whether AL after colonic cancer surgery increases the risk of disease recurrence.
        Methods: This was a nationwide cohort study of 9333 patients, prospectively registered in the database of the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group and merged with data from the Danish Pathology Registry and the National Patient Registry. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding.
        Results: The incidence of AL was 6.4\%, 744 patients died within 120 days. Of the remaining 8589 patients, 861 (10.0\%) developed local recurrence with no association to AL [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.55–1.12; P = 0.184]. Distant recurrence developed in 1281 (14.9\%) patients and more frequently after AL (adjusted HR = 1.42; 95\% CI: 1.13–1.78; P = 0.003). AL was also associated with increased long-term mortality (adjusted HR = 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.01–1.44; P = 0.042). In 2841 patients with stage III cancer, AL was associated with both decreased likelihood of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (adjusted HR = 0.58; 95\% CI: 0.45–0.74; P {\textless} 0.001) and a delay to initial administration (16 days; 95\% CI: 12–20 days; P {\textless} 0.001).
        Conclusions: AL was significantly associated with increased rates of distant recurrence and long-term all-cause mortality. Cancelled or delayed administration of adjuvant chemotherapy may partly account for these findings.},

	abstract = {Aim Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a major challenge in colorectal cancer surgery due to increased morbidity and mortality. Possible risk factors should be investigated differentially, distinguishing between rectal and colonic surgery in large-scale studies to avoid selection bias and confounding. Method The incidence and risk factors associated with AL were analysed in an unselected nationwide prospective cohort of patient subjected to curative colonic cancer surgery with primary anastomosis and entered into The Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database between May 2001 and December 2008. Results AL occurred in 593 (6.4\%) of 9333 patients. Laparoscopic surgery [odds ratio (OR) 1.34; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.70; P = 0.03); left hemicolectomy (OR 2.02; 95\% CI 1.50–2.72; P = 0.01) or sigmoid colectomy (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.32–2.17; P = 0.01); intra-operative blood loss (OR 1.04; 95\% CI 1.01–1.07; P = 0.03); blood transfusion (OR 10.27; 95\% CI 6.82–15.45; P {\textless} 0.001) and male gender (OR 1.41; 95\% CI 1.12–1.75; P = 0.02) were associated with AL in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion The main finding that a laparoscopic approach was associated with an increased risk of AL should prompt close future monitoring. There was no evidence that centralization of surgery to high-volume hospitals reduced the rate of AL.},

This study was done to evaluate the impact of standard microsurgery through laparotomy and the additional benefit of an oxidized regenerated cellulose adhesion barrier (INTERCEED [TC7] Absorbable Adhesion Barrier [Ethicon Inc.]), in reducing pelvic sidewall adhesion re-formation. One hundred and thirty-four patients with bilateral pelvic sidewall adhesions undergoing adhesiolysis by standard microsurgical techniques through laparotomy were treated during a prospective randomized trial involving 13 centers. After adhesiolysis, the deperitonealized surface of one pelvic sidewall was randomly assigned to be covered with INTERCEED Barrier, the contralateral sidewall serving as control. A second-look laparoscopy was performed ten days to 14 weeks postoperatively. Microsurgical adhesiolysis alone resulted in 24 percent of the sidewalls becoming free of adhesions and a 55.6 percent reduction in the area of adherent peritoneum. With microsurgery alone, 60 and 39 percent of adhesions initially characterized as filmy or severe, respectively, were not seen at second-look laparoscopy. The use of INTERCEED Barrier increased the incidence of adhesion-free sidewalls twofold. The treatment was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in the area of peritoneum affected by adhesion re-formation, compared with the control wall. Of the adhesions originally graded as severe, 61 percent of those treated with INTERCEED Barrier did not re-form at all. When evaluated on filmy adhesions, the use of the barrier was associated with a 72 percent reduction in adhesion re-formation. A measurable reduction in adhesion re-formation was found, depending on the initial adhesion type, with microsurgery alone. The addition of INTERCEED Barrier further reduced the incidence, extent and severity of postoperative adhesion re-formation. In this study, 90 percent of the patients benefited from the use of INTERCEED Barrier.},

	abstract = {Background Postoperative adhesions are the result of aberrant peritoneal healing. As they are the leading cause of postoperative bowel obstruction, anti-adherence barriers are advocated for their prevention. This study looks into the effect of these biomaterials on the healing of intestinal anastomoses. Materials and Methods Thirty-three New Zealand White rabbits underwent laparotomy, transection of the terminal ileum, and creation of an end-to-end anastomosis. Animals were randomized into 3 groups: the Control group (n = 11); the Icodextrin group, receiving icodextrin 4\% intraperitonealy (n = 11); and the HA/CMC group, having the anastomosis wrapped with a hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose film (n = 11). All animals were sacrificed on the seventh postoperative day. Macroscopic adhesions were graded and anastomotic strength was tested by the burst pressure. Histological healing was assessed in a semiquantitative way for the presence of ulceration, reepithelization, granulation tissue, inflammation, eosinophilic infiltration, serosal inflammation, and microscopic adhesions. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used. Results are given as medians with interquartile range. Results The median adhesion scores were the following: Control 1 (0-3), Icodextrin 0 (0-1), HA/CMC 0 (0-0), P = .017. The burst pressure did not differ between the groups; however, all except one bowel segments tested burst away from the anastomosis. The macroscopic and histological anastomotic healing was comparable in all 3 groups. A poor histological anastomotic healing score was associated with a higher adhesion grade (odds ratio = 1.92; 95\% confidence interval = 1.06-3.47; P = .032). Conclusion Adhesion formation was inhibited by the materials tested without direct detrimental effects on anastomotic healing. Poor anastomotic healing provokes adhesions even in the presence of anti-adhesion barriers.},

	abstract = {In this study, we aimed to assess whether thermo-responsive in-situ forming hydrogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) could prevent post-operative peritendinous adhesion. The clinical advantages of the thermo-responsive hydrogels are acting as barrier material to block penetration of fibroblasts, providing mobility and flexibility during application and enabling injection through a small opening to fill spaces of any shape after surgery. The thermo-responsiveness of hydrogels was determined to ensure their clinic uses. By grafting hydrophilic biopolymers chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) to PNIPAM, the copolymer hydrogels show enhanced water retention and lubrication, while reduced volume shrinkage during phase transition. In cell culture experiments, the thermo-responsive hydrogel has good biocompatibility and reduces fibroblast penetration. In animal experiments, the effectiveness of preventing post-operative peritendinous adhesion was studied in a rabbit deep flexor tendon model. From gross examination, histology, bending angles of joints, tendon gliding excursion and pull-out force, HA-CS-PNIPAM (HACPN) was confirmed to be the best barrier material to prevent post-operative peritendinous adhesion compared to PNIPAM and CS-PNIPAM (CPN) hydrogels and a commercial barrier film Seprafilm®. There was no significant difference in the breaking strength of HACPN-treated tendons and spontaneously healed ones, indicating HACPN hydrogel application did not interfere with normal tendon healing. We conclude that HACPN hydrogel can provide the best functional outcomes to significantly prevent post-operative tendon adhesion in vivo.
Statement of Significance
We prepared thermo-responsive in-situ forming hydrogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) to prevent post-operative peritendinous adhesion. The injectable barrier hydrogel could have better anti-adhesive properties than current commercial products by acting as barrier material to block penetration of fibroblasts, providing mobility and flexibility during application and enabling injection through a small opening to fill spaces of any shape after surgery. The effectiveness of preventing post-operative peritendinous adhesion was studied in a rabbit deep flexor tendon model. From gross examination, histology, bending angles of joints, tendon gliding excursion and pull-out force, HA-CS-PNIPAM (HACPN) was confirmed to be the best barrier material to prevent post-operative peritendinous adhesion compared to PNIPAM and CS-PNIPAM (CPN) hydrogels and a commercial barrier film Seprafilm®.},

In order to prevent the formation of POA, a number of strategies have been developed, among which an emerging method is physical barriers consisting of polymer materials. This review highlights the most commonly used natural and synthetic polymer materials in anti-adhesion physical barriers. The specific features of polymer materials are analyzed and compared, and the possible prospect is also predicted.
Statement of Significance
Postoperative adhesion (POA) is a serious complication accompanied with various surgeries. Polymer material-based physical barriers have attracted a large amount of attention in POA prevention. The polymer barriers can effectively avoid the formation of fibrous tissues among normal organs by reducing the interconnection of injured tissues. In this review, specific features of the natural and synthetic polymer materials for application in POA prevention were presented, and the possible prospects were predicted. All in all, our work can provide inspiration for researchers to choose proper polymer materials for preclinical and even clinical anti-adhesion studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To review currently available evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy to reduce the formation of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions.
METHODS: A search on Pubmed and the Cochrane library was undertaken using the keywords “abdominal”, “adhesion”, “postoperative”, “prevention” and “reduction”. Only randomised controlled trials, prospective non-randomised controlled studies and review articles published in the English language between 1990 and 2006 were included.
RESULTS: Two prospective non-randomised controlled studies and 18 randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Adjuvant therapies reviewed included pharmacological agents (streptokinase, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, vitamin E antioxidant molecules), and mechanical barriers (hyaluronic acid barriers, oxidised regenerated cellulose barriers, nanofibrous barriers and collagen foils). Hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm) appeared to be the most efficacious in reducing adhesion formation as well as decreasing the incidence of adhesion obstruction requiring reoperation in clinical studies. Drawbacks to the use of Seprafilm include high cost and complications such as haemorrhage and poor wound healing.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a limited number of adjuvant treatment methods are currently available for the reduction of postoperative adhesions. Seprafilm has been proven to be the efficacious method to reduce adhesions. Investigations into the novel therapies are showing promising results in experimental studies and clinical studies before their wider application. [Asian J Surg 2009;32(3):180–6]},

	abstract = {Background
Postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and contribute to a heavy burden on health care resources. At present, numerous introduced adhesion prevention products have demonstrated some benefit but none are consistently effective. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of recombinant human lubricin in preventing intra-abdominal adhesion formation.
Materials and methods
A total of 62 male Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to the study. Six rats were used to the initial pilot study and 56 rats were randomized into four groups: (1) control cecal abrasion; (2) treatment cecal abrasion with 0.5 mg/mL lubricin solution; (3) control cecal enterotomy and primary closure; and (4) treatment cecal enterotomy and primary closure with 0.5 mg/mL lubricin solution. Rats were sacrificed at 3 d and 21 d postoperatively for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Macroscopic and microscopic adhesion severity was graded by blinded investigators.
Results
For the pilot study, all six rats successfully reached the end point indicating safety of the lubricin gel. In the main randomized study, adhesions in the treated cecal abrasion group were significantly reduced both macroscopically (P = 0.001) and microscopically (fibrosis P = 0.009, inflammation P {\textless} 0.0001), when compared with the control group. In the cecal enterotomy group, adhesions were reduced for the treatment group in macroscopic (P = 0.011) and microscopic grading (fibrosis P = 0.500, inflammation P = 0.206) compared with the control group.
Conclusions
Recombinant human lubricin significantly reduced both macroscopic and microscopic intra-abdominal adhesions in the cecal abrasion group. The cecal enterotomy group showed modest macroscopic adhesion reduction. Future study using higher concentration of lubricin solution are needed to investigate its toxicity and more profound antiadhesion properties in significant operations.},

	abstract = {Preventing the unwanted adsorption of proteins and cells at articular cartilage surfaces plays a critical role in maintaining healthy joints and avoiding degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Immobilized at the surface of healthy articular cartilage is a thin, interfacial layer of macromolecules consisting mainly of hyaluronic acid (HA) and lubricin (LUB; a.k.a. PRG4) that is believed to form a co-adsorbed, composite film now known to exhibit synergistic tribological properties. Bioinspired by the composition of cartilage surfaces, composite layers of HA and LUB were grafted to Au surfaces and the antiadhesive properties were assessed using surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance. A clear synergistic enhancement in antiadhesive properties was observed in the composite films relative to grafted HA and LUB layers alone. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) normal force measurements provide insight into the architecture of the HA/LUB composite layer and implicate a strong contribution of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of LUB end-domains directly to HA chains. These AFM force measurements indicate that the adhesion of LUB to HA is strong and indicate that the hydrophobic coupling of LUB to HA shields the hydrophobic domains in these molecules from interactions with other proteins or molecules.},

	abstract = {Mussels use a variety of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (DOPA) rich proteins specifically tailored to adhering to wet surfaces. Synthetic polypeptide analogues of adhesive mussel foot proteins (specifically mfp-3) are used to study the role of DOPA in adhesion. The mussel-inspired peptide is a random copolymer of DOPA and N5- (2-hydroxyethyl)-L-glutamine synthesized with DOPA concentrations of 0–27 mol\% and molecular weights of 5.9–7.1 kDa. Thin films (3–5 nm thick) of the mussel-inspired peptide are used in the surface forces apparatus (SFA) to measure the force–distance profiles and adhesion and cohesion energies of the films in an acetate buffer. The adhesion energies of the mussel-inspired peptide films to mica and TiO2 surfaces increase with DOPA concentration. The adhesion energy to mica is 0.09 μJ m−2 molDOPA−1 and does not depend on contact time or load. The adhesion energy to TiO2 is 0.29 μJ m−2 molDOPA−1 for short contact times and increases to 0.51 μJ m−2 molDOPA−1 for contact times {\textgreater}60 min in a way suggestive of a phase transition within the film. Oxidation of DOPA to the quinone form, either by addition of periodate or by increasing the pH, increases the thickness and reduces the cohesion of the films. Adding thiol containing polymers between the oxidized films recovers some of the cohesion strength. Comparison of the mussel-inspired peptide films to previous studies on mfp-3 thin films show that the strong adhesion and cohesion in mfp-3 films can be attributed to DOPA groups favorably oriented within or at the interface of these films.},

Here, we confirmed Dopa-Fe3+ complexation of interfacial MAPs and investigated the effects of Dopa-Fe3+ complexation regarding both surface adhesion and cohesion. The force measurements using surface forces apparatus (SFA) analysis showed that intrinsic strong surface adhesion at low pH, which is similar to the local acidified environment present during the secretion of adhesive proteins, vanishes by Dopa-Fe3+ complexation and alternatively, strong cohesion is generated in higher pH conditions similar to seawater. A high Dopa content increased the capacity for both surface adhesion and cohesion, but not at the same time. In contrast, a lack of Dopa resulted in both weak surface adhesion and cohesion without significant effects of Fe3+ complexation. Our findings shed light on how mussels regulate Dopa functionality at the plaque/substrate interface, in response to the microenvironment, and might provide new insight for the design of mussel-inspired biomaterials.},

However, the long epidermal application time required for drug implantation by existing LbL MN strategies (15−90 min) can lead to potential medication noncompliance. Here, we developed a MN platform to shorten the application time in MN therapies based on a synthetic pH-induced charge-invertible polymer poly(2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate-b-methacrylic acid) (PDM), requiring only 1 min skin insertion time to implant LbL ﬁlms in vivo. Following MN-mediated delivery of 0.5 μg model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA) in the skin of mice, this system achieved sustained release over 3 days and led to an elevated immune response as demonstrated by signiﬁcantly higher humoral immunity compared with OVA administration via conventional routes (subcutaneously and intramuscularly). Moreover, in an ex vivo experiment on human skin, we achieved eﬃcient immune activation through MN-delivered LbL ﬁlms, demonstrated by a rapid uptake of vaccine adjuvants by the antigen presenting cells. These features, rapid administration and the ability to elicit a robust immune response, can potentially enable a broad application of microneedle-based vaccination technologies.},

To address this issue at an essential barrier tissue, the skin, we created a microneedle-based technology for longitudinal sampling of cells and interstitial fluid, enabling minimally invasive parallel monitoring of immune responses. Solid microneedle projections were coated by a cross-linked biocompatible polymer, which swells upon skin insertion, forming a porous matrix for local leukocyte infiltration. By embedding molecular adjuvants and specific antigens encapsulated in nanocapsules within the hydrogel coating, antigen-specific lymphocytes can be enriched in the recovered cell population, allowing for subsequent detailed phenotypic and functional analysis. We demonstrate this approach in mice immunized with a model protein antigen or infected in the skin with vaccinia virus. After vaccination or infection, sampling microneedles allowed tissue-resident memory T cells (T

	abstract = {Minimally invasive technologies that can sample and detect cell-free nucleic acid biomarkers from liquid biopsies have recently emerged as clinically useful for early diagnosis of a broad range of pathologies, including cancer. Although blood has so far been the most commonly interrogated bodily ﬂuid, skin interstitial ﬂuid has been mostly overlooked despite containing the same broad variety of molecular biomarkers originating from cells and surrounding blood capillaries. Emerging technologies to sample this ﬂuid in a pain-free and minimally-invasive manner often take the form of microneedle patches. Herein, we developed microneedles that are coated with an alginate−peptide nucleic acid hybrid material for sequence-speciﬁc sampling, isolation, and detection of nucleic acid biomarkers from skin interstitial ﬂuid. Characterized by fast sampling kinetics and large sampling capacity (∼6.5 μL in 2 min), this platform technology also enables the detection of speciﬁc nucleic acid biomarkers either on the patch itself or in solution after light-triggered release from the hydrogel. Considering the emergence of cell-free nucleic acids in bodily ﬂuids as clinically informative biomarkers, platform technologies that can detect them in an automated and minimally invasive fashion have great potential for personalized diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of patient-speciﬁc disease progression.},

Herein, we report Janus adhesive tape with an asymmetrically crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) network prepared through an interfacial hydrosilylation strategy, realizing wet/dry amphibious adhesion on various solid surfaces. The lightly crosslinked side of the Janus adhesive tape acts as an adhesive layer with high adhesion, and the highly crosslinked side functions as a supporting layer with high mechanical strength. This Janus adhesive tape with good adhesion and mechanical properties can be dyed different colors and can act as an underwater adhesive and a skin adhesive for wearable electronic devices. This study provides a promising design model for next-generation adhesive materials and related applications.},

	abstract = {Toxicity, low adhesion strength, and complexity of application are the major challenges that prevent utilization of synthetic surgical adhesives. To address this challenge, a platform of fully synthetic UVA curing bioadhesive is evaluated on the binary composites consisting of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) grafted with aryl-diazirine (PAMAM-g-diazirine, PDz) and multi-arm polycaprolactone triols (PCLT). PCLT is chosen as a bioresorbable polymer matrix that serves as a plasticizer for the viscous PDz. Upon low dose UVA light, grafted diazirine converts to reactive carbenes that crosslink by covalent insertion. Rheological investigation created G″ vs. G′ vector maps of the liquid-to-solid transition, allowing comparison of PDz/PCLT ratio, PCLT molar mass, and type of plasticizer. The vector maps reveal crosslinking kinetics are dependent on the PCLT concentration within the composite, while the molar mass of liquid PCLT does not aﬀect the crosslinking kinetics. Liquid PDz/PCLT composite adheres to dry substrates as well as hydrated soft tissue mimics. Infrared spectroscopy provides an insight into the crosslinking mechanism where UVA-generated carbenes covalently insert into proximate polymer chains mainly on –O–H sites. Carbene-induced intermolecular locking transforms the material from liquid to elastomeric composite polymer matrix in less than 10 J per sq. cm of UVA exposure.},

In particular, wound closure in internal organs poses major clinical challenges due to air/ﬂuid leakage, local ischemia, and subsequent impairment of healing. Herein, to overcome these limitations, inspired by endoparasites that swell their proboscis to anchor to host's intestines, we developed a hydrogel-forming double-layered adhesive microneedle (MN) patch consisting of a swellable mussel adhesive protein (MAP)-based shell and a non-swellable silk ﬁbroin (SF)-based core. By possessing tissue insertion capability (7-times greater than the force for porcine skin penetration), MAP-derived surface adhesion, and selective swelling-mediated physical entanglement, our hydrogel-forming adhesive MN patch achieved ex vivo superior wound sealing capacity against luminal leaks (139.7 ± 14.1 mmHg), which was comparable to suture (151.0 ± 23.3 mmHg), as well as in vivo excellent performance for wet and/or dynamic external and internal tissues. Collectively, our bioinspired adhesive MN patch can be successfully used in diverse practical applications ranging from vascular and gastrointestinal wound healing to transdermal delivery for proregenerative or anti-inﬂammatory agents to target tissues.},

Here we investigate the formation of hard (irreversible) and soft (reversible) protein corona around model nanoparticles (NPs) coated with sulfobetaine (SB), phosphorylcholine (PC) and carboxybetaine (CB) polymer ligands in model albumin solutions and in whole serum. We show for the ﬁrst time a complete absence of protein corona around SB-coated NPs, while PC- and CB-coated NPs undergo reversible adsorption or partial aggregation. These dramatic diﬀerences cannot be described by naïve hard/soft acid/base electrostatic interactions. Single NP tracking in the cytoplasm of live cells corroborate these in vitro observations. Finally, while modiﬁcation of SB polymers with additional charged groups lead to consequent protein adsorption, addition of small neutral targeting moieties preserves antifouling and enable eﬃcient intracellular targeting.},

However, ventral hernia repairs remain challenging with an inherent risk of post-surgical adhesions in the peritoneal space which can occur regardless of interventional material or its surgical placement. Herein, amino acid-based poly(ester urea)s (PEUs) with varied amount of an allyl ether side chains were modiﬁed post polymerization modiﬁcation with the zwitterionic sulfnate group (3-((3-((3-mercaptopropanoyl)oxy)propyl) dimethylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate) to promote anti-adhesive properties. These alloc-PEUs were processed using roll-to-roll fabrication methods to aﬀord ﬁlms that were amenable to surface functionalization via a zwitterion-thiol. Functional group availability on the surface was conﬁrmed via ﬂuorescence microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. Zwitterionic treated PEUs exhibited reduced ﬁbrinogen adsorption in vitro when compared to unfunctionalized control polymer. A rat intrabdominal cecal abrasion adhesion model was used to assess the extent and tenacity of adhesion formation in the presence of the PEUs. The 10\% alloc-PEU zwitterion functionalized material was found to reduce the extent and tenacity of adhesions when compared to adhesion controls and the unfunctionalized PEU controls.},

	abstract = {Hemostasis is a prerequisite for wound healing, and under normal physiologic conditions, it is achieved by means of the coagulation cascade. However, there are a number of surgical procedures where there may be considerable benefits to the patient, surgeon, or health-care costs if hemostasis can be achieved more efficiently. The rapid and effective control of bleeding during and after surgery reduces blood loss and can help reduce postoperative complications. These improved outcomes can reduce the need for transfusion, with the associated risk of viral transmission, and have a positive impact on operative and hospital stay times. Fibrin sealants are surgical hemostatic agents derived from human plasma that reproduce the final steps in the coagulation pathway and form a stable fibrin clot. Fibrin sealants are used in a broad range of surgical procedures to assist hemostasis, including cardiovascular, hepatic, and splenic surgery, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, skin grafting, and dental extractions in anticoagulated patients. Patients with coagulopathies are at high risk of prolonged or excessive bleeding during or after invasive surgery, and these patients may also benefit from the use of fibrin sealants. This article reviews the role of fibrin sealants in hemostasis, citing a number of key clinical studies that report a significant reduction in blood loss or chest drain output after surgery with fibrin sealant compared with controls.},

	abstract = {For the first time, a convenient copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, click chemistry) was successfully introduced into injectable citrate-based mussel-inspired bioadhesives (iCMBAs, iCs) to improve both cohesive and wet adhesive strengths and elongate the degradation time, providing numerous advantages in surgical applications. The major challenge in developing such adhesives was the mutual inhibition effect between the oxidant used for crosslinking catechol groups and the Cu(II) reductant used for CuAAC, which was successfully minimized by adding a biocompatible buffering agent typically used in cell culture, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), as a copper chelating agent. Among the investigated formulations, the highest adhesion strength achieved (223.11 ± 15.94 kPa) was around 13 times higher than that of a commercially available fibrin glue (15.4 ± 2.8 kPa). In addition, dual-crosslinked (i.e. click crosslinking and mussel-inspired crosslinking) iCMBAs still preserved considerable antibacterial and antifungal capabilities that are beneficial for the bioadhesives used as hemostatic adhesives or sealants for wound management.},

Quantitative measurements of shear strength for applications in tissue engineering and biomedicine are performed in torsion using a rheometer. Small, disk shaped specimens of soft biological tissues and/or hydrogels (8 mm diameter, 1–2 mm thick) are mounted onto rheometer tools and then bonded together using the adhesive to be tested. The torsional loading geometry imposes simple shear without deforming the planar adhesive bond, in contrast to the lap-shear test. It retains the advantages of the napkin ring test while reducing artifacts due to cutting and handling soft specimens. The method is demonstrated by measuring the shear strength of two types of biomedical adhesives (cyanoacrylate and polyethylene glycol-based) between model hydrogels (gelatin) and tissues (corneal stroma and skin). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Despite significant advancement of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based biomedical research, studies have not been done enough to understand biodegradability of functional MSNs for better clinical efficacy. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is one of the mostly used surface functionalities of MSNs, owing to the amine-rich chemical composition and the well-known proton sponge effect. In this paper, we study degradation behaviors of PEI-coated MSNs (PEI-MSNs) under a neutral or acidic physiological condition in comparison to those of surface-uncoated or nonionic F-127-encapsulated MSNs. The results showed that the surface coating by PEI could promote particle degradation in both neutral and acidic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (i.e., pH 7.4 and 5.0). Importantly, we demonstrated that the local pH buffering by the surface PEI could lead to a greater total degradation quantity of particles even in the acidic PBS solution. The PEI-induced pH buffering phenomenon was confirmed by using a fluorescent pH indicator dye, fluorescein, which was attached to the surface of PEI-MSNs (F-PEI-MSNs). The observed pH-insensitive fluorescing behavior of fluorescein attained by surface coating with PEI corroborates the buffering effect that minimizes the surface pH change regardless of the external pH. The presented results may offer a useful insight into the degradability of silica nanomaterials with PEI or related surface functionalities, especially in the acidic subcellular microenvironment.},

The nanoparticulates were prepared by emulsiﬁcation/solvent evaporation methods and release determined in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37 ◦C. The release proﬁles exhibited an initial burst release phase, a slower lag phase and a second increased release rate phase. The proﬁles were consistent with a model in which the ﬁrst phase of the release reﬂects diffusion controlled dissolution of drug accessible to the solid/dissolution medium interface and the second phase reﬂects release of drug entrapped in the polymer, the release of which was dependent on the bulk degradation of the polymer. The burst phase tended to increase with increase in API loading and solubility. The polymer erosion related parameters also indicated that increased drug loading accelerated this phase of API release. Small acidic hydrophobic actives such as ketoprofen and indomethacin had a much greater effect on these parameters than the larger hydrophilic more neutral proteins, HSA and ovalbumin.},

Both non-degradable and degradable polymers have found wide applications in the controlled delivery field. Studies on drug release kinetics provide important information into the function of material systems. To elucidate the detailed transport mechanism and the structurefunction relationship of a material system, it is critical to bridge the gap between the macroscopic data and the transport behavior at the molecular level. Areas covered in this review: The structure and function information of selected non-degradable and degradable polymers have been collected and summarized from literature published after the 1990s. The release kinetics of selected drug compounds from various material systems is discussed in case studies. Recent progress in the mathematical models based on different transport mechanisms is highlighted. What the reader will gain: This article aims to provide an overview of structure-function relationships of selected non-degradable and degradable polymers as drug delivery matrices. Take home message: Understanding the structure-function relationship of the material system is key to the successful design of a delivery system for a particular application. Moreover, developing complex polymeric matrices requires more robust mathematical models to elucidate the solute transport mechanisms.},

Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, counting 50 patients/research group, we compared two frequently used silver dressings, ActicoatTM and Aquacel1 Ag, in the management of partial thickness burns with a predicted healing time between 7 and 21 days as assessed by laser Doppler imaging between 48 and 72 h after burn. Variables investigated were related to baseline research group characteristics, wound healing, bacteriology, economics, nurse, and patient experience.
Results: Both research groups were comparably composed taking into account gender, age and burn characteristics. Similar results were obtained as to healing time and bacterial control with both silver dressings. A statistically signiﬁcant difference in favor of the Aquacel1 Ag dressing was found for average ease of use ( p {\textless} 0.001), average ease of application ( p = 0.001), patient pain ( p {\textless} 0.001), patient comfort with the dressing ( p = 0.017), silver staining ( p {\textless} 0.001), and cost effectiveness ( p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: Both silver dressings resulted in comparable healing times and bacterial control but the Aquacel1 Ag dressing signiﬁcantly increased comfort for patients as well as nurses and was signiﬁcantly more cost-effective than the ActicoatTM dressing for the given indication.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial susceptibility testing plays a key role in clinical microbiology. The disk diffusion test dates back to the 1940s and became standardised from the 1950s, with the International Collaborative Study (ICS) and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) as the two major standards. Interlaboratory variation of disk test results was recognised early but has never been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. The error-rate bounded method was described in 1974 and its role is discussed. Species-specific susceptibility interpretation was coined in 1980 for Proteus mirabilis and chloramphenicol. In the late 1970s, more extensive use of species-specific breakpoints was introduced in Lund (Sweden). At the same time, P. Mouton constructed species-specific regression lines and pointed out the difficulties with narrow ranges of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. A more general use of species-specific regression lines was made possible with single-strain regression analysis, using one well-defined strain tested in disk diffusion with a range of disk contents. This method made it possible to calibrate the disk test in an individual laboratory. Other methods to achieve such calibration are also described. A recent method, ‘MIC-coloured zone diameter histogram-technique’, has proven useful for the validation of species-specific interpretive breakpoints. The microbiological breakpoint proposed by Williams in 1990 has experienced a renaissance with the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF). MIC and zone diameter distributions with accompanying ECOFFs for species–antimicrobial combinations are published on the EUCAST website. A method for the reconstruction of wild-type zone diameter populations, namely normalised resistance interpretation, is described. This method can produce resistance figures that are truly comparable between laboratories.},

In height and phase images of PPO/PES blend samples, the relative contrast of chemically different regions depends sensitively on the rsp and A0 values. As the tip−sample force is increased from small to large, both phase and height images of PPO/PES blend samples can undergo a contrast reversal twice. This makes it difficult to assign the features of height and phase images to different chemical components without performing additional experiments. Phase and height images were interpreted by analyzing several factors that affect the dependence of phase shift and amplitude damping on rsp and A0.},

The polymer solution has been spin-coated on a glass slide. PnBMA builds a uniform film on the glass substrate with a thickness of @200 nm. On top of it, the PS builds an approximately 100 nm thick film. The PS-film undergoes dewetting, leading to the formation of holes surrounded by about 2 µm large rims. In those regions of the sample, where the distance between the holes is larger than about 4 µm, light depressions in the PS film can be observed. Topography, dissipated energy, adhesion, stiffness and elastic modulus have been measured on these three regions (PnBMA, PS in the rims and PS in the depressions). The two polymers can be distinguished in all images, since PnBMA has a higher adhesion and a smaller stiffness than PS, and hence a higher dissipated energy. Moreover, the polystyrene in the depressions shows a very high adhesion (approximately as high as PnBMA) and its stiffness is intermediate between that of PnBMA and that of PS in the rims. This is attributed to higher mobility of the PS chains in the depressions, which are precursors of new holes.},

	abstract = {Pressure sensitive adhesives made with blends of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs PSAs) with satisfactory tack, cohesion, and adhesion have been developed. A simple procedure consisting of the physical blending of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) solutions of two thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) with very different properties\&mdash;TPU1 and TPU2\&mdash;was used, and two different blending procedures have been employed. The TPUs were characterized by infra-red spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-IR spectroscopy), differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, and plate-plate rheology (temperature and frequency sweeps). The TPUs PSAs were characterized by tack measurement, creep test, and the 180\&deg; peel test at 25 \&deg;C. The procedure for preparing the blends of the TPUs determined differently their viscoelastic properties, and the properties of the TPUs PSAs as well, the blending of separate MEK solutions of the two TPUs imparted higher tack and 180\&deg; peel strength than the blending of the two TPUs in MEK. TPU1 + TPU2 blends showed somewhat similar contributions of the free and hydrogen-bonded urethane groups and they had an almost similar degree of phase separation, irrespective of the composition of the blend. Two main thermal decompositions at 308\&ndash;317 \&deg;C due to the urethane hard domains and another at 363\&ndash;373 \&deg;C due to the soft domains could be distinguished in the TPU1 + TPU2 blends, the weight loss of the hard domains increased and the one of the soft domains decreased by increasing the amount of TPU2 in the blends. The storage moduli of the TPU1 + TPU2 blends were similar for temperatures lower than 20 \&deg;C and the moduli at the cross over of the moduli were lower than in the parent TPUs. The improved properties of the TPU1 + TPU2 blends derived from the creation of a higher number of hydrogen bonds upon removal of the MEK solvent, which lead to a lower degree of phase separation between the soft and the hard domains than in the parent TPUs. As a consequence, the properties of the TPU1 + TPU2 PSAs were improved because good tack, high 180\&deg; peel strength, and sufficient cohesion were obtained, particularly in 70 wt\% TPU1 + 30 wt\% TPU2 PSA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study looks at six different modern wound dressings to investigate how likely they are to cause skin stripping and impairment of the skin's barrier function.
METHOD: Healthy volunteers had each dressing applied, removed and reapplied to the skin on their back over the study period of 15 days. Skin barrier function was investigated using the amount of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and then related to the amount of skin stripping, investigated by measuring stained skin removal, the thickness of the stratum corneum after treatment, and the amount of skin attached to the removed dressings. General signs of trauma, such as skin dryness and erythema, were investigated by subjective and objective parameters.
RESULTS: TEWL values measured on the untreated test area, as well as after application of Urgotul Trio, remained relatively unchanged and Mepilex Border decreased slightly (?1g/m2/h), while all other dressings displayed an increased in TEWL: Allevyn Adhesive (5g/m2/h), Versiva XC (14g/m2/h), Comfeel Plus (22g/m2/h) and Biatain (28g/m2/h). By the end of the study, only the untreated area (mean 43\% dye remaining), Mepilex Border (76\%) and Urgotul Trio (34\%) areas had visible dye remaining. It is interesting to note that the untreated site had a colour change, suggesting loss of stratum corneum, due to the shedding of skin cells from the surface. The increase in total skin colour for Comfeel Plus and Biatain after day 8 might be assigned to an increased redness due to erythema. All the dressings showed evidence of stratum corneum attached to the adhesive, except Mepilex Border, which appeared to be free of any attached stratum corneum.
CONCLUSION: Overall the best performance in terms of skin protection and failure to cause skin trauma was found to be for Mepilex Border.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST: This project was funded by a grant from Mölnlycke Healthcare Ltd.},

Elucidating cytotoxic effects and influence on proliferation/migration capacity of cells like fibroblasts is of interest. Dressings’ effects were investigated by comprehensive in vitro approach: (1) MTT assay measuring cell viability after direct contact, (2) ATP assay determining effects on cell proliferation, and (3) scratch wound assay featuring an in vitro wound healing model. One cotton-based dressing with vaseline (vas) was included in the study and four polyester dressings containing vas and technology-lipido-colloid matrix (TLC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydrocolloid (HC), or glycerin (gly) as additives. A polyamide dressing with vas + CMC and three silicone-based dressings (AT, CC, M) were tested. Polyester + vas + CMC did not negatively affect cell viability or proliferation but it was found that fibroblast layers appeared more irregular with decreased F-actin network structure and tubulin density possibly leading to hampered scratch closure. Silicone AT, polyester + gly and polyamide + vas + CMC caused distinct cell damage. The latter two further reduced cell viability, proliferation and scratch healing. From the overall results, it can be concluded that cotton + vas, polyester + TLC, polyester + vas + HC and the silicone dressings CC and M have the potential to prevent damage of newly formed tissue during dressing changes and positively influence wound healing.},

This review aims to discuss the available data on the use of both more traditional wound care products and newer wound care technologies in these populations, including medical-grade honey, nanocrystalline silver, and soft silicone-based adhesive technology., Critical Issues: Evidence-based wound care practices and demonstration of the safety, efficacy, and appropriate utilization of available wound care dressings and products in the neonatal and pediatric populations should be established to address specific concerns regarding wound management in these populations., Future Directions: The creation and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of common wounds in the neonatal and pediatric populations is essential. In addition to an evaluation of currently marketed wound care dressings and products used in the adult population, newer wound care technologies should also be evaluated for use in neonates and children. In addition, further investigation of the specific pathophysiology of wound healing in neonates and children is indicated to promote the development of wound care dressings and products with specific applications in these populations.},

OBJECTIVE: We describe three patients who developed eczematous lesions under this type of wound covering.
METHODS: The patients were patch tested to the European standard series, to a glues and adhesives series, and to pieces of various adhesive dressings.
RESULTS: The patients displayed positive patch tests to colophony and to DuoDERM E or DuoDERM CGF hydrocolloid dressings.
CONCLUSION: These dressings contain the pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin as a tackifying agent, and this substance retains the sensitizing potential of colophony. The addition of this compound is an important change that may negatively alter the good safety record of ConvaTec dressings.},

	abstract = {Significance: Injury to the skin provides a unique challenge, as wound healing is a complex and intricate process. Acute wounds have the potential to move from the acute wound to chronic wounds, requiring the physician to have a thorough understanding of outside interventions to bring these wounds back into the healing cascade., Recent Advances: The development of new and effective interventions in wound care remains an area of intense research. Negative pressure wound therapy has undoubtedly changed wound care from this point forward and has proven beneficial for a variety of wounds. Hydroconductive dressings are another category that is emerging with studies underway. Other modalities such as hyperbaric oxygen, growth factors, biologic dressings, skin substitutes, and regenerative materials have also proven efficacious in advancing the wound-healing process through a variety of mechanisms., Critical Issues: There is an overwhelming amount of wound dressings available in the market. This implies the lack of full understanding of wound care and management. The point of using advanced dressings is to improve upon specific wound characteristics to bring it as close to “ideal” as possible. It is only after properly assessing the wound characteristics and obtaining knowledge about available products that the “ideal” dressing may be chosen., Future Directions: The future of wound healing at this point remains unknown. Few high-quality, randomized controlled trials evaluating wound dressings exist and do not clearly demonstrate superiority of many materials or categories. Comparative effectiveness research can be used as a tool to evaluate topical therapy for wound care moving into the future. Until further data emerge, education on the available products and logical clinical thought must prevail.},

This emerging research field has been driven by increasing sustainability requirements in the adhesive industry and bridges the gap existing between highly optimized petroleum-based synthetic PSA systems, which display superior performance but lack biobased content, and historical PSAs derived from naturally occurring biopolymers (e.g., starch and natural rubber), which provide more environmentally friendly bonding solutions but have inherent technical limitations that prevent their more widespread implementation in today's technically demanding applications. We critically reviewed a representative (and exhaustive) survey of recent synthetic approaches to the development of biobased PSAs from the academic (articles) and industrial (patents) literature categorized in two families: chain-growth and step-growth polymerization routes. Finally, we draw a parallel between renewable synthetic PSAs and nature's self-adhesive glues, highlighting how the synergy between green chemistry and biomimetic concepts could inspire the emergence of a new generation of smart, synthetic, biobased PSAs with differentiated properties that approach the ones that are found in the natural world and with a wide spectrum of potential applications in the industrial and medical sectors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Medical adhesive bandages are extensively used in both inpatient and outpatient medicine. However, few reports describing proven allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) from medical adhesive bandages exist in the literature. These reports do not adequately correspond to the frequency that patients report having an ‘‘allergy’’ to medical adhesive bandages.
Objective: To determine if there is a chemical present in medical adhesive bandages that causes ACD in people who identify themselves as having an ‘‘allergy’’ to medical adhesive bandages.
Methods: Twenty-six patients were enrolled and underwent patch testing with our standard trays (104 chemicals) and a customized adhesive tray (54 chemicals and 10 tapes and bandages in their whole form).
Results: We were able to identify an allergen in four patients that was related to their presumed adhesive allergy (Mastisol, neomycin/bacitracin [two different patients], and cortisone-10 cream, respectively). However, there were no positive allergic reactions to the tapes or bandages or any relevant allergic reactions to our customized adhesive tray. Eight (73\%) of the 11 patients who had the bandage or tape left on for 7 days had an irritant reaction.
Conclusion: We feel that the perceived reactions are not secondary to ACD but instead are due to an irritant contact dermatitis. M EDICAL ADHESIVE TAPES AND BANDAGES consist of a pressure-sensitive adhesive and a},

In this study, the thermal stability of acrylic polymer containing maleimide (Mal) functional groups has been investigated. The PSAs were synthesized by acrylic monomers and Mal through copolymerization. The influence of Mal on the viscosity, molecular weight (Mw, Mn), glass transition temperature, thermogravimetric analysis and contact angle of acrylic PSAs was also studied. The adhesion performance and thermal stability of acrylic PSAs could be significantly enhanced by increase in Mal content of the synthesized resin. After 3 h of treatment in drying oven at 170 °C, the modified PSAs can be peeled (180°) off from the substrate without residues on substrate surface at room temperature, while the non-modified acrylic PSAs possessed residues after treatment from 110 °C. The maximum 180° peel strength of modified PSA films was 12.7 N/25 mm when the content of Mal was 7.5 wt\%.},

Functional comonomers increase cohesive strength, provide surface polarity, and enhance wear performance. Tack, adhesion to skin, adhesive transfer to skin, and wear performance of the adhesive are governed by the molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and the viscoelastic behavior of the adhesive. Viscoelastic properties of the adhesive as measured by the Williams plasticity number (WPN), dynamic storage modulus (G′), dynamic loss modulus (G″), and tan δ are important polymer properties for good wear performance. Sweating skin, a moist environment, and physical activity are the most important factors influencing the failure of an adhesive tape during wear. A medicalgrade adhesive for application to human skin should be hypoallergenic.

We have addressed the effect of m-PSA composition on intrinsic solid surface energetics and on the mechanical performance of m-PSA. The measured surface energies of the m-PSA were all approximately 30 mJ m-2, indicating surfaces dominated by methylene groups. The extent of adhesion hysteresis for the m-PSA used in our measurements was not a strong function of acrylic acid content implying that the main mechanism contributing to the adhesion of practical un-cross-linked or lightly cross-linked PSA is the viscoelastic dissipation. Several technical and physical issues concerning contact mechanical measurement of adhesion and the observed rate-dependent patterns of adhesion have been addressed.},

Microgels formed in the lattices retained their discrete network morphology in the film. In contrast, acrylic solution was essentially gel free and crosslinking in the film was provided by the reaction of acrylic acid and post added Al Acetyl Acetonate after solvent evaporation, which led to continuous network morphology. The difference in film network morphology caused significantly lower shear holding power for the film from emulsion PSA compared with that of solvent-borne film. Unlike shear holding power, loop tack and peel of acrylic PSAs were mainly controlled by the same sol/gel molecular parameters, regardless of emulsion or solution PSAs. The important molecular parameters are sol-to-gel ratio, entanglement molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and to a lesser extent, glass transition temperature. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {There are two essential requirements of medical pressure sensitive adhesives: that they should stick firmly to a difficult substrate (skin) and that they should be easily and cleanly removed from that substrate when desired. These requirements would seem to be in conflict: a high peel force usually signals the ability to stick firmly, while a low force is needed when removing dressings by peeling. A number of ways have been considered to resolve this conflict. These may be divided into two broad categories: those that make the best of existing pressure sensitive adhesives technology, broadly taking a physical approach, and those that introduce novel chemistry into the process. Physical approaches consider such details as the dependence of peel force on peel angle, peel rate, backing materials, the deformation of the skin during peeling and use of barrier films and solvents. As an alternative to simply making the best of the physics of the peeling process, various workers have devised chemical systems for making the adhesive less strongly adhering at the time of removal. These systems usually consist of introducing a ‘switch’ mechanism into a strongly adhering adhesive so that its adherence may be reduced significantly at the time of removal by operation of the ‘switch’. Means of activating the ‘switch’ include: heat (warming or cooling), application of water via an absorbent backing and exposure to visible light. These may produce physical or chemical changes in the adhesive. While these approaches bring benefits to patients, consideration of the science behind them is leading to an enhanced understanding of the peeling process.},

	abstract = {The development of new adhesive wound care products intended for an application over a prolonged time requires good water transporting properties of the adhesive for the maintenance of a suitable environment around the wound. The ability of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based silicone films to transport water has led to its use in skin pressure-sensitive adhesives and it would be advantageous to find ways for controlling or increasing water transport across PDMS films in order to be able to develop improved skin adhesives. In this study we present a way to increase water transport in such films by the addition of hydrophilic excipients. Three hydrophilic additives, highly water-soluble sucrose and the two superabsorbent polymers (SAP) Carbopol® and Pemulen™, were investigated. The effect of the excipients was characterized by water transport studies, swelling tests, scanning electron microscopy imaging and confocal microscopy. The cross-linked polymers, primarily Pemulen™, were efficient water transport enhancers, whereas sucrose did not show any effect. The effect of the additives seemed to correlate with their water binding capacity. For SAPs the formation of a percolating structure by swollen polymer was also suggested, which enhances water penetration by the higher volume fraction of areas with a higher diffusion constant (swollen SAP), leading to a faster transport through the entire film.},

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of the phenomenon, and to identify and quantify the main prognostic factors associated. Design: Multicentric, prognostic prospective cohort study. Setting: Shoulder Orthopaedic surgery, General surgery, Advanced Oncology therapies, Gastro-entero mininvasive surgery and Endocrine surgery. Participants: One thousand and two patients who underwent chest, abdominal, upper limb and joint laparotomic surgery consecutively admitted to the surgical units involved, were included. Methods: Data regarding individual and patient care variables, such as intrinsic (e.g. age and gender) and extrinsic (e.g. surgery type and time) data were collected. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify the variables which independently influenced the onset of the tape blister. Results: In the multivariate analysis, patients who underwent chest (Odds Ratio = 8.99, 95\% CI 5.33–15.13), and upper limb and joint surgery (Odds Ratio = 2.09, 95\% CI 1.22–3.58) were more likely to develop tape blisters in the postoperative period, At the same time, having drainage (Odds Ratio = 1.98, 95\% CI 1.11–3.53), being female (Odds Ratio = 1.56, 95\% CI 1.01–2.44) and having a high Body Mass Index (BMI) score (Odds Ratio: 1.06, 95\% CI 1.02–1.11) were also predictors of tape blister formation. Conclusions: A higher BMI score, chest, upper limb and joint surgery, female gender and the presence of drainage were predictive factors of the tape blister event while, in contrast with the literature, the type of dressing used in this study was not significantly associated with the event.},

	abstract = {A fundamental approach to fabricating silicone-based adhesives with highly tunable adhesion force for the skin-contact applications is presented. Liquid blends consisting of vinyl-multifunctional polydimethylsiloxane (V-PDMS), hydride-terminated PDMS (H-PDMS), and a tackifier composed of a silanol-terminated PDMS/MQ resin mixture and the MQ resin are used as the adhesive materials. The peel adhesion force of addition-cured adhesives on the skin is increased by increasing the H-PDMS molecular weights and the tackifier content, and decreasing the H-PDMS/V-PDMS ratio. There is an inverse relationship between the adhesion force and the Young's modulus. The low-modulus adhesives with a low H-PDMS/V-PDMS ratio exhibit enhanced adhesion properties. The low-modulus adhesives with the high MQ resin content show significantly enhanced adhesion properties. These adhesives exhibit a wide range of modulus (2–499 kPa), and their adhesion force (0.04–5.38 N) is superior to commercially available soft silicone adhesives (0.82–2.79 N). The strong adhesives ({\textgreater}≈2 N) provide sufficient adhesion for fixing the flexible electrocardiogram (ECG) device to the skin in most daily activity. The human ECG signals are successfully recorded in real time. These results suggest that the silicone-based adhesives should be useful as an atraumatic adhesive for the skin-contact applications.},

Currently, limited strategies exist for the delivery of these therapeutic cells with tissue-like cellular organization. With the added risks related to suturing of corneal implants, there is a pressing need to develop new tissue adhesive biomaterials for corneal regeneration. To address these issues, we grafted dopamine moieties into hydrazone-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA-DOPA) hydrogels to impart tissue adhesive properties and facilitate covalent surface modiﬁcation of the gels with basement membrane proteins or peptides. We achieved tissue-like cellular compartmentalization in the implants by encapsulating hASCs inside the hydrogels, with subsequent conjugation of thiolated collagen IV or laminin peptides and LESC seeding on the hydrogel surface. The encapsulated hASCs in HA-DOPA gels exhibited good proliferation and cell elongation, while the LESCs expressed typical limbal epithelial progenitor markers. Importantly, the compartmentalized HA-DOPA implants displayed excellent tissue adhesion upon implantation in a porcine corneal organ culture model. These results encourage sutureless implantation of functional stem cells as the next generation of corneal regeneration.},

However, achieving high conformity against the three-dimensionally (3D) rough and curved surfaces of the human body remains an enduring challenge for further medical applications of wound protection, diagnosis, or therapeutics. Here, an adhesive patch inspired by the soft wrinkles of miniaturized 3D octopus suction cups is presented for high drainability and robust attachment against dry and wet human organs. Investigating the structural aspects of the wrinkles, a simple model is developed to maximize capillary interactions of the wrinkles against wet substrates. A layer of soft siloxane derivative is then transferred onto the wrinkles to enhance ﬁxation against dry and sweaty skin as well as various wet organ surfaces. Our bioinspired patch oﬀers opportunities for enhancing the versatility of adhesives for developing skin- and/or organ-attachable devices.},

The model consists of silk porous sponge, which is pre-seeded with rat brain-derived neurons, immersed in soft collagen matrix.

          , 
            Hydrogels are a unique class of polymeric materials that possess an interconnected porous network across various length scales from nano- to macroscopic dimensions and exhibit remarkable structure-derived properties, including high surface area, an accommodating matrix, inherent flexibility, controllable mechanical strength, and excellent biocompatibility. Strong and robust adhesion between hydrogels and substrates is highly desirable for their integration into and subsequent performance in biomedical devices and systems. However, the adhesive behavior of hydrogels is severely weakened by the large amount of water that interacts with the adhesive groups reducing the interfacial interactions. The challenges of developing tough hydrogel–solid interfaces and robust bonding in wet conditions are analogous to the adhesion problems solved by marine organisms. Inspired by mussel adhesion, a variety of catechol-functionalized adhesive hydrogels have been developed, opening a door for the design of multi-functional platforms. This review is structured to give a comprehensive overview of adhesive hydrogels starting with the fundamental challenges of underwater adhesion, followed by synthetic approaches and fabrication techniques, as well as characterization methods, and finally their practical applications in tissue repair and regeneration, antifouling and antimicrobial applications, drug delivery, and cell encapsulation and delivery. Insights on these topics will provide rational guidelines for using nature's blueprints to develop hydrogel materials with advanced functionalities and uncompromised adhesive properties.},

	abstract = {Efficient initiation and resolution of inflammation are crucial for wound repair. However, with using tissue adhesives for wound repair, patients occasionally suffered from delayed healing process because slow elimination of those exogenous adhesives generally leads to chronic inflammation. As the demand for minimal invasive therapy continues to rise, desire for adhesive materials that can effectively reconnect surgical gaps and promote wound regeneration becomes increasingly urgent. Herein, by exploiting the inherent porous structure and performance of adhesion to tissue of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), we demonstrate a tissue adhesive that can elicit acute inflammatory response and get eliminated after tissue reformation. With formation of nanocomposites in wound gaps, the injured tissues can get reconnected conveniently. The resultant accelerated healing process verify that the strategy of exploiting unique properties of nanomaterials can effectively promote inflammation resolution and wound repair. This design strategy will inspire more innovative tissue adhesives for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Effective strategies for post-surgical adhesion prevention have increasingly focused on injectable adhesion barriers due to their minimal invasiveness and wider applicability. In this study, a thermo-reversible hydrogel was developed by combining high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) at various concentrations (0.05, 0.25, and 0.45\% w/v) with tempo-oxidized nanocellulose (TOCN), methyl cellulose (MC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for anti-adhesion application. The hydrogel preparation time was short and did not require any chemical modification. TOCN ensured the mechanical stability of the hydrogel. MC confirmed thermo-sensitive feature. Higher amounts of HA increased the rate of hydrogel degradation. The HA 0.25 hydrogel was freeflowing, injectable at ambient temperature, capable of faster (40±2 s), and reversible sol-gel (4℃37℃) transition. A rat side-wall cecum abrasion model was used to confirm the complete de novo adhesion prevention efficacy of optimized HA 0.25 hydrogel, where the scratched abdominal wall of animals treated with HA 0.25 hydrogel healed after 14 days. During in vivo experiment, PEG in the hydrogel played a crucial role in adhesion prevention by minimizing friction between the surgical site and nearby organs. In a nutshell, HA 0.25 hydrogel, fabricated without crosslinking agent, is a potential candidate for tissue adhesion prevention strategies.},

This material exhibits a transition from liquid to solid but, diﬀerently from most reactive glues, is completely held together by non-covalent interactions, i.e., electrostatic and hydrophobic. Because the solidiﬁcation results in a kinetically trapped morphology, the ﬁnal mechanical properties strongly depend on the preparation conditions and on the surrounding environment. A systematic study is performed to assess the eﬀect of ionic strength and of PNIPAM content on the thermal, rheological and adhesive properties. This study enables the optimization of polymer composition and environmental conditions for this underwater adhesive system. The best performance with a work of adhesion of 6.5 J/m2 was found for the complex coacervates prepared at high ionic strength (0.75 M NaCl) and at an optimal PNIPAM content around 30\% mol/mol. The high ionic strength enables injectability, while the hydrated PNIPAM domains provide additional dissipation, without softening the material so much that it becomes too weak to resist detaching stress.},

	abstract = {Development of mechanically strong and adhesive hydrogels with self-recovery and self-healing properties is important for many applications but has proven to be very challenging. Here, we reported a double-network design strategy to synthesize a fully physically cross-linked doublenetwork (DN) hydrogel, consisting of the ﬁrst gelatin network and the second poly(N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide) network where both networks were mainly cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The resultant gelatin/pHEAA hydrogels exhibited high mechanical property (tensile stress of 1.93 MPa, tensile strain of 8.22, tearing energy of 4584 J/m2), fast self-recovery at room temperature (toughness/stiﬀness recovery of 70.2\%/ 68.0\% after 10 min resting), and good self-healing property (self-healed tensile stress/strain of 0.62 MPa/3.2 at 60 °C for 6 h). More importantly, gelatin/pHEAA hydrogels also exhibited strong surface adhesion on diﬀerent hydrophilic solid surfaces, as indicated by high adhesion energy (i.e., interfacial toughness) of 645 J/m2 on glass, 867 J/m2 on Al, 702 J/m2 on Ti, and 579 J/m2 on ceramics. Surface adhesion can be largely retained after multiple, repeatable adhere on/peel oﬀ actions. Reversible and strong mechanical properties in bulk and on solid surfaces are likely attributed to reversible hydrogen bondings and physical coordinate bonds between the networks and between networks and surfaces. This work demonstrates our design principle that multiple physical bonds in both networks oﬀer excellent mechanical recoverability, self-healing, and self-adhesive properties, while DN structure provides strong and tough mechanical properties via eﬃcient energy dissipation by sacriﬁced bonds, which oﬀers a new possibility to develop next-generation hydrogels with desirable properties used for soft robotics, wearable electronics, and human−machine interfaces.},

Engineered surfaces that reduce the adhesion, proliferation, and spread of bacteria have promise as a mean of preventing infections and reducing the use of antibiotics. To address this need, we created a ﬂexible plastic wrap that combines a hierarchical wrinkled structure with chemical functionalization to reduce bacterial adhesion, bioﬁlm formation, and the transfer of bacteria through an intermediate surface. These hierarchical wraps were eﬀective for reducing bioﬁlm formation of World Health Organization-designated priority pathogens Gram positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 87 and 84\%, respectively. In addition, these surfaces remain free of bacteria after being touched by a contaminated surface with Gram negative E. coli. We showed that these properties are the result of broad liquid repellency of the engineered surfaces and the presence of reduced anchor points for bacterial adhesion on the hierarchical structure. Such wraps are fabricated using scalable bottom-up techniques and form an eﬀective cover on a variety of complex objects, making them superior to top-down and substrate-speciﬁc surface modiﬁcation methods.},

However, it is still a signiﬁcant challenge to control their mechanics while maintaining their gelation behavior, due to the interdependency between gelation kinetics and mechanics. Herein, physicomechanical properties of in situ forming chitosan hydrogels via Schiﬀ base formation are tuned in a wide range, while maintaining gelation kinetics, via polymer graft architecture. By introducing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafts with varying lengths and densities, the resulting PEGgrafted chitosan (‘PEG-g-Cs’) not only dissolve readily in neutral aqueous media, but also eﬀectively control the mechanical properties of hydrogels, while maintaining facile gelation kinetics. These properties are further controlled by the chain length of polymeric crosslinker, PEG-dialdehyde. In addition, tissue adhesive properties of the hydrogels are further examined using ex vivo and in vivo models for their potential applications as tissue sealants.},

During semi-structured interviews, patients and health professionals discussed their positive experience of glue‑as-a-dressing and no dressing around six themes: wound contamination and infection, wound healing, wound care, physical protection afforded by simple dressings, the potential psychological impact of an exposed wound, and ability to carry out everyday tasks. Current views on the practice of dressings for primary abdominal wounds are influenced by ingrained clinical practice.

The lack of understanding hinders the development and application of tissue adhesive hydrogels, particularly in the applications interfacing with repeatedly deforming tissues such as heart and lung. Here we study the interfacial fatigue fracture of a tissue adhesive hydrogel based on tough hydrogel, called tough adhesive (TA), using a fracture mechanics approach. We perform modified lap-shear tests with three types of loading (e.g., monotonic, static, and cyclic loads). We observe shakedown of the load-displacement curves during cycling and two interfacial fracture phenomena: fast debonding and interfacial fatigue fracture. We confirm the existence of a fatigue threshold (24.4 J m-2) for the TA-skin interface, below which the interface is immune against prolonged cyclic deformation. The threshold is lower than the adhesion energy (580 J m-2) for fast debonding. We also compare the interfacial fatigue fracture with the fatigue of bulk hydrogels. This work will promote further mechanistic investigation on interfacial fatigue fracture and the development of fatigue-resistant tissue adhesives.},

Overall, we observed a trade-oﬀ in how the addition of salt and alcohol aﬀected the phase behavior and rheology of the coacervates and, consequently, the size of the resulting ﬁbers. While salt served to weaken electrostatic associations within the coacervate and decrease the precursor solution viscosity, the addition of alcohol lowered the dielectric constant of the system and strengthened these interactions. We hypothesize that the optimized concentration of alcohol accelerated the solvent evaporation during the electrospinning process to yield desirable nanoﬁber morphology. The smallest average nanoﬁber diameter was determined to be 115 ± 30 nm when coacervate samples were electrospun using an aqueous solvent containing 3 wt \% ethanol and an applied voltage of 24 kV. These results demonstrate a potentially scalable strategy to manufacture electrospun nanoﬁbers from biopolymer complex coacervates that eliminate the need for toxic solvents and could enable the use of these materials across a range of biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {The ability to engineer immune function has transformed modern medicine, highlighted by the success of vaccinations and recent eﬀorts in cancer immunotherapy. Further directions in programming the immune system focus on the design of immunomodulatory biomaterials that can recruit, engage with, and program immune cells locally in vivo. Here, we synthesized shear-thinning and self-healing polymer−nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels as a tunable and injectable biomaterial platform for local dendritic cell (DC) recruitment. PNP gels were formed from two populations of poly(ethylene glycol)-blockpolylactide (PEG-b-PLA) NPs with the same diameter but diﬀerent PEG brush length (2 or 5 kDa). PEG-b-PLA NPs with the longer PEG brush exhibited improved gel formation following self-assembly and faster recovery after shear-thinning. In all cases, model protein therapeutics were released via Fickian diﬀusion in vitro, and minor diﬀerences in the release rate between the gel formulations were observed. PNP hydrogels were loaded with the DC cytokine CCL21 and injected subcutaneously in a murine model. CCL21-loaded PNP hydrogels recruited DCs preferentially to the site of injection in vivo relative to non-CCL21-loaded hydrogels. Thus, PNP hydrogels comprise a simple and tunable platform biomaterial for in vivo immunomodulation following minimally invasive subcutaneous injection.},

	abstract = {Various 3D printing techniques currently use degradable polymers such as aliphatic polyesters to create welldeﬁned scaﬀolds. Even though degradable polymers are inﬂuenced by the printing process, and this subsequently aﬀects the mechanical properties and degradation proﬁle, degradation of the polymer during the process is not often considered. Degradable scaﬀolds are today printed and cell−material interactions evaluated without considering the fact that the polymer change while printing the scaﬀold. Our methodology herein was to vary the printing parameters such as temperature, pressure, and speed to deﬁne the relationship between printability, polymer microstructure, composition, degradation proﬁle during the process, and rheological behavior. We used high molecular weight medical-grade (co)polymers, poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PCLA), poly(Llactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA), with L-lactide content ranging from 25 to 100 mol \%, for printing in an extrusion-based printer (3D Bioplotter). Optical microscopy conﬁrmed that the polymers were printable at high resolution and good speed, until a certain degree of degradation. The results show also that printability can not be claimed just by optimizing printing parameters and highlight the importance of a careful analysis of how the polymer’s structure and properties vary during printing. The polymers thermally decomposed from the ﬁrst processing minute and caused a decrease in the average block length of the lactide blocks in the copolymers and generated lower crystallinity. Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and PCLA are printable at a higher molecular weight, less degradation before printing was possible, compared to PLGA and PDLGA, a result explained by the higher complex viscosity and more elastic polymeric melt of the copolymer containing glycolide (GA) and lactide (LA). In more detail, copolymers comprised of LA and ε-caprolactone (CL) formed lower molecular weight compounds over the course of printing, while the PLGA copolymer was more susceptible to intermolecular transesteriﬁcation reactions, which do not aﬀect the overall molecular weight, but cause changes in the copolymer microstructure. This results in a longer printing time for PLGA than PLLA and PCLA.},

However, the diﬃculty in removing the residue caused by the excessive adhesive strength and sluggish degradation or nondegradation behaviors of the adhesive has always been challenging. Inspired by the multiple complementary hydrogen bond interactions in DNA, the bioinspired nucleobase (A, T, and U) monomers were ﬁrst synthesized and used to tackify polyphosphoester hydrogels. The multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between purine rings and pyrimidine functionalities endowed the hydrogels with excellent controllable adhesive properties. Besides this, it has been found that these nucleobase-tackiﬁed hydrogels could be easily peeled oﬀ without leaving any residue and could be totally degraded under alkaline conditions due to hydrolysis of phosphoester chains. At the same time, they also exhibited controllable biodegradation to diﬀerent extents under the diﬀerent pH conditions. The excellent adhesive performance, controllable biodegradation, and excellent biocompatibility showed by this nucleobase-tackiﬁed polyphosphoester adhesive hydrogel demonstrated its great potential in wound dressing, as a tissue sealant, and so on.},

	abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies affect up to 2 billion people and are the leading cause of cognitive and physical disorders in the developing world. Food fortification is effective in treating micronutrient deficiencies; however, its global implementation has been limited by technical challenges in maintaining micronutrient stability during cooking and storage. We hypothesized that polymer-based encapsulation could address this and facilitate micronutrient absorption. We identified poly(butylmethacrylate-co-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate-co-methylmethacrylate) (1:2:1) (BMC) as a material with proven safety, offering stability in boiling water, rapid dissolution in gastric acid, and the ability to encapsulate distinct micronutrients. We encapsulated 11 micronutrients (iron; iodine; zinc; and vitamins A, B2, niacin, biotin, folic acid, B12, C, and D) and co-encapsulated up to 4 micronutrients. Encapsulation improved micronutrient stability against heat, light, moisture, and oxidation. Rodent studies confirmed rapid micronutrient release in the stomach and intestinal absorption. Bioavailability of iron from microparticles, compared to free iron, was lower in an initial human study. An organotypic human intestinal model revealed that increased iron loading and decreased polymer content would improve absorption. Using process development approaches capable of kilogram-scale synthesis, we increased iron loading more than 30-fold. Scaled batches tested in a follow-up human study exhibited up to 89\% relative iron bioavailability compared to free iron. Collectively, these studies describe a broad approach for clinical translation of a heat-stable ingestible micronutrient delivery platform with the potential to improve micronutrient deficiency in the developing world. These approaches could potentially be applied toward clinical translation of other materials, such as natural polymers, for encapsulation and oral delivery of micronutrients.},

The hydrogel is based on a visible-light-activated naturally derived polymer (gelatin) and an antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The optimized formulation of GelAMP could be rapidly crosslinked using commercial dental curing systems. When compared with commercial adhesives, GelAMP exhibited signiﬁcantly higher adhesion to physiological tissues and titanium surfaces. Moreover, the bioadhesive showed high cytocompatibility and could efﬁciently promote cell proliferation and migration in vitro. GelAMP also showed remarkable antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis. Furthermore, it could support the growth of autologous bone after sealing calvarial bone defects in mice. Overall, GelAMP could be used as a platform for the development of more effective therapies against PIDs.},

The data show that hybrid aptamer−ﬁbrinogen macromers can assemble to form hydrogels. Moreover, the assembled hydrogels can recognize vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for sustained release. When the VEGF-loaded hydrogels are implanted in vivo, they can promote angiogenesis and skin wound healing.

We found that the nanomatrix coated stent could increase endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation (potential for reendothelialization), discourage smooth muscle cell migration and adhesion (potential to reduce neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis), and decrease both platelet activation and adhesion (potential to prevent thrombosis) as well as monocyte adhesion (potential to attenuate inﬂammatory responses) under physiological ﬂow conditions in vitro.

Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) have been extensively studied as thermoplastic homoand copolymers as well as PCL−PLLA blends. PCL−PLLA semi-interpenetrating networks (semi-IPNs) prepared with thermoplastic PLLA embedded in a cross-linked PCL diacrylate (PCL−DA) network were previously shown to exhibit uniquely accelerated degradation behavior that increased with PLLA content. Herein, their properties before and during degradation were further investigated to reveal the origin of this behavior and to better understand the semi-IPNs’ degradation mechanism. Initially, semi-IPNs exhibited restricted spherulite size and irregularity, as well as a phase-separated morphology and a PLLA-rich surface. Under accelerated conditions (1 M NaOH, 37 °C), degradation was revealed to be initiated in PLLA regions. It was also found that the PCL−DA cross-linking and PCL−PLLA phase separation played the largest roles in degradation rates and that semi-IPNs underwent faster rates of degradation than an analogous blend largely due to the reduced crystallinity of PCL−DA. Nonaccelerated conditions (PBS [pH = 7.4], 37 °C) up to 56 weeks, which had never before been studied for polyester semi-IPNs, revealed similar trends in degradation rates.},

As a range of factors, including materials, geometry and design of the microneedles, affect the performance, it is important to understand the relationships between them and the resulting delivery of therapeutics. Accordingly, there is a need for appropriate methodologies and techniques for characterization and evaluation of microneedle performance, which will also be discussed. As the research expands, it has been observed that therapeutics delivered via microneedles has gained expedited access to the lymphatics, which makes them a favorable delivery method for targeting the lymphatic system. Such opportunity is valuable in the area of vaccination and treatment of lymphatic disorders, which is the ﬁnal focus of the review. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Despite their advantages over sutures and staples, currently available tissue glues are limited by their mechanical properties and toxicity. Here, a new approach is described for wound closure that is based on a biocompatible, low melting point four-armed N-hydroxy succinimide-modified polycaprolactone (star-PCL-NHS). Star-PCL-NHS is inserted into a hot melt glue gun, melts upon minimal pressure, and is extruded directly onto the wound, where it solidifies, bonding strongly with both edges of the wound. Changes in molecular weight allow control of adhesive strength, melting point, and elasticity properties. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm the biocompatibility of this system. The straightforward synthetic scheme and the simple delivery method, combined with the desirable mechanical properties, tunability, and tissue compatibility, are desirable traits in wound management.},

Consequently, the meaning of the term ?skin adhesive patch? becomes broader and smarter compared to the traditional term.

Even if satisfactory adhesion to the skin is strictly linked to the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic treatment, nowadays numerous reports of in vivo ‘adhesion lacking’ are still addressed to regulatory agencies. The adhesive properties of a patch should be characterized considering i) the ability to form a bond with the surface of another material on brief contact and under light pressure (tack); ii) the resistance of the adhesive to flow (shear adhesion); and iii) the force required to peel away a patch from a surface (peel adhesion). Areas covered: In this manuscript, the most widely used methods to measure adhesive properties during development studies are described, along with the quality control of patches. The influence of formulative variables on patch adhesive properties, and their possible relationship with the in vivo adhesion performances, is also discussed. Expert opinion: The Pharmacopoeias should consider the opportunity of introducing compendial testing to assay the quality of adhesive patch properties, and regulatory agencies should issue proper guidelines to evaluate these features during development.},

Particularly, the thickness of grafted PIPPAm chains in the perpendicular direction is regulated to achieve temperature-dependent alteration of cell sheet preparation/harvesting. The 2D positioning of grafted PIPAAm in a direction parallel to the material surfaces facilitates spatially controlled micropatterns containing heterotypic cells. This review also describes the 2D manipulation of cell sheets and the creation of cell sheet-layered 3D tissue using the PIPAAm-grafted surface. With the aid of supporting materials such as membranes and gelatin hydrogels, cell sheets on PIPAAm-grafted surfaces can be manipulated and applied for transplantation in clinical settings and for the formation of 3D tissues in vitro. For the next generation of cell sheet-based tissue engineering, a challenging issue is the creation of large, thick tissues/organs such as cardiac and hepatic tissues/organs. The integration of various technologies including bioreactors and micropatterning is essential to achieve the creation of functional engineered 3D organs.},

In order to address this problem, the clarification on adhesion loss mechanism and the development of effective alternatives of commercial hydrocolloid dressings are urgent and inevitable. Herein, adhesion loss mechanism of hydrocolloid dressings was investigated using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-filled hydrocolloid dressings exposing to physiological environment as model. The adhesion mechanism and contact angle tests were combined to obtain surface energy of dressings. The results indicated that the dissolution, swelling and exudation of CMC occurred successively (concentration reached 1.607 g/L after 10 h). The effused CMC led to the dramatic increase in surface energy (from 14.5–80.7 mN/m) and adhesion loss appeared. This work explored the origin of adhesion loss of hydrocolloid wound dressings and might promote the designing of hydrocolloid dressings with both excellent humidity control and sustained self-adhesiveness.},

The basis for the three components γLW s, γ⊕s, and γ⊖s is developed, and an algebraic expression for these properties in terms of measured contact angles is presented. The inadequacy of the 'two-liquid' methodology (which yields a parameter, 'γp') is demonstrated. Attention is given to contact angle hysteresis and to the film pressure, πe. Some recommendations are made with regard to contact angle measurements. A new treatment of hydrophilicity, and of the scale of hydrophobic/hydrophilic behavior, is proposed. It is shown that there are two kinds of hydrophilic behavior, one due to Lewis basicity (electron-donating or proton-accepting structures) and the other due to Lewis acidity (electron-accepting or proton-donating structures). The properties γ⊖ and γ⊕ are the quantitative measures of these types of behavior and they are structurally independent of each other. A triangular diagram, with γLW at the hydrophobic corner, and γ⊕ and γ⊖ at the two hydrophillic corners, is suggested.},

The amount of adhesive deposit was determined quantitatively by tracer technique although the unbonding process was apparently observed as interface failure. The adhesive force and amount of deposit were both dependent on the critical surface tension of the adherends. Maximum tack value and contamination were observed with adherends whose critical surface tension was close to that but a little higher than that of the adhesive. The adhesive force obtained was lower than cohesive strength of adhesive. From this evidence, a mechanism for pressure-sensitive adhesion was discussed: the bond breaks in the addesive mass around the very minute spots where interaction is at work between adhesive and adherend. Inasmuch as the density of the minute spots per unit area depends on the surface tension, the adhesive force also depends on the surface tension.},

The surface energies of the adhesive, substrate and of the interface between them determine the extent of wetting or spreading at equilibrium. Numerical values for surface energies may be obtained either from contact angle measurements or from analysing force–displacement curves obtained from the surface forces apparatus. The extent to which the relationships, appropriate for plane surfaces, may be modified to take into account interfacial roughness are discussed. For modest extents of roughness, the application of a simple roughness factor may be satisfactory, but this is unrealistic for many of the practical surfaces of relevance to adhesive technology which are very rough, and is ultimately meaningless, if the surface is fractal in nature. Some examples are discussed of published work involving polymer–metal and polymer–polymer adhesion, where the roughness of the interface exerts a significant influence on the adhesion obtained. Roughness over a range of scales from microns to nanometres may strengthen an interface, increasing fracture energy by allowing bulk energy dissipating processes to be activated when the bond is stressed.},

In order to study the influence of substrate SFE on tack the adherents with the same surface roughness (expressed by selected amplitude parameters) were used: PTFE, PP, PE, ABS, PC, PMMA, stainless steel and glass. The relationship between substrate roughness and tack was investigated using two polypropylene plates (PP and PPrough) characterized as having the same wettability (SFE). For tack determination the most common method in the PSA tapes industry was employed (loop tack test). The conducted experiments showed that substrate SFE is a crucial factor governing tack properties of acrylic PSAs. In general, a larger difference between the SFE values of the substrate and adhesive were correlated with greater tack values. The dependence of tack and SFE was significantly influenced by crosslinking degree and layer coat weight of model acrylic PSA. The experiments carried out in the second part of the study revealed that the adhesive׳s viscoelastic properties control the tack properties on rough substrates, however, the final tack performance was found to be strongly affected by the level of substrate roughness and PSA thickness.},

Adhesive bonding is gaining more and more interest due to the increasing demand for joining similar or dissimilar structural components, mostly within the framework of designing lightweight structures. When two materials are brought in contact, the proper or adequate adhesion between them is of great importance, so it is necessary to device ways to attain the requisite adhesion strength between similar or dissimilar materials including the different combinations of metallic materials, polymers, composite materials and ceramics. To make adhesion possible, it is necessary to generate intrinsic adhesion forces across the interface. The magnitude and the nature of those forces are very important. From a thermodynamic standpoint the true work of adhesion (or intrinsic property) of the interface create free surfaces from the bonded materials. Adhesion mechanisms have been known to be dependant on the surface characteristics of the materials in question. The intrinsic adhesion between the adhesive and substrates arises from the fact that all materials have forces of attraction acting between their atoms and molecules, and a direct measure of these interatomic and intermolecular forces is surface tension. Atomic/molecular understanding of adhesion should be extremely beneficial in selecting or creating the appropriate materials to attain the desired adhesion strength. In the present paper, the following topics are reviewed in detail: (a) the surfaces or interfaces of similar and dissimilar materials, (b) adhesion or bonding mechanisms in the adhesive joints (c) thermodynamic theory of adhesion: surface tension or surface free energy concepts including the wetting, wetting criteria, wettability, and thermodynamic work of adhesion, (d) dispersion and polar components of surface free energies, and finally (e) effect of surface roughness on wettability or adhesion.},

	abstract = {The surface energy and adhesion dynamics of pressure sensitive adhesives-like networks (PSA-LNs) as mimics for PSAs were studied using JKR-based contact mechanics and peel tests. Acrylic acid (AA) was co-polymerized with 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate (2-EHA) and 1,6-hexane diol diacrylate (HDDA) to create PSA-LNs. The measured surface energy (27 to 31 mJ/m2) was sensible as surmised from their structure. Acrylic acid content increases the surface energy, threshold adhesion energy and adhesion hysteresis of PSA-LNs. Measurements of adhesion dynamics showed a dependence of adhesion energy to the 0.6–0.8 power of crack speed, depending upon the model chosen for analysis of the data. When compared with actual pressure-sensitive adhesive tape peel tests, the adhesion dynamics data predicted the peel strength. This study shows a direct relationship between threshold adhesion energy, crack propagation mechanics and peel strength measurements.},

	abstract = {Conventional wound dressings are difficult to apply to large total body surface area (TBSA) wounds, as they typically are prefabricated, require a layer of adhesive coating for fixation, and need frequent replacement for entrapped exudate. Large TBSA wounds as well as orthopedic trauma and low-resource surgery also have a high risk of infection. In this report, a sprayable and intrinsically adhesive wound dressing loaded with antimicrobial silver is investigated that provides personalized fabrication with minimal patient contact. The dressing is composed of adhesive and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA/PEG) blend fibers with or without silver salt (AgNO3). in vitro studies demonstrate that the PLGA/PEG/Ag dressing has antimicrobial properties and low cytotoxicity, with antimicrobial silver controllably released over 7–14 days. In a porcine partial-thickness wound model, the wounds treated with both antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial PLGA/PEG dressings heal at rates similar to those of the clinical, thin film polyurethane wound dressing, with similar scarring. However, PLGA/PEG adds a number of features beneficial for wound healing: greater exudate absorption, integration into the wound, a 25\% reduction in dressing changes, and tissue regeneration with greater vascularization. There is also modest improvement in epidermis thickness compared to the control wound dressing.},

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.},

Elucidation of the prefusion structure of the RSV F glycoprotein and its identification as the main target of neutralizing antibodies have provided new opportunities for development of an effective vaccine. Here, we describe the structure-based design of a self-assembling protein nanoparticle presenting a prefusion-stabilized variant of the F glycoprotein trimer (DS-Cav1) in a repetitive array on the nanoparticle exterior. The two-component nature of the nanoparticle scaffold enabled the production of highly ordered, monodisperse immunogens that display DS-Cav1 at controllable density. In mice and nonhuman primates, the full-valency nanoparticle immunogen displaying 20 DS-Cav1 trimers induced neutralizing antibody responses ∼10-fold higher than trimeric DS-Cav1. These results motivate continued development of this promising nanoparticle RSV vaccine candidate and establish computationally designed two-component nanoparticles as a robust and customizable platform for structure-based vaccine design.,

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.

In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spreading and increasing worldwide. There is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-nCoV using immunoinformatics approach. Method: We will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-nCoV strain; in addition, 10 MHC1 and MHC2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5\% and 99.99\% respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019-nCoV using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months. The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined. Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment. Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003, China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period.},

We immunised rhesus macaques intramuscularly with a combination of the three Ad5-SARS-CoV vectors or a control vector and gave a booster vaccination on day 28. The vaccinated animals all had antibody responses against spike protein S1 fragment and T-cell responses against the nucleocapsid protein. All vaccinated animals showed strong neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV infection in vitro. These results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce strong SARS-CoV-specific immune responses in the monkey, and hold promise for development of a protective vaccine against the SARS causal agent.},

Sporadic cases and outbreaks continue to be reported in the Middle East, and case fatality rates remain high at approximately 36\% globally. No specific preventive or therapeutic countermeasures currently exist. A safe and effective vaccine could play an important role in protecting against the threat from MERS-CoV. This review discusses human vaccine candidates currently under development, and explores viral characteristics, molecular epidemiology and immunology relevant to MERS-CoV vaccine development. At present, a DNA vaccine candidate has begun a human clinical trial, while two vector-based candidates will very soon begin human trials. Protein-based vaccines are still at pre-clinical stage. Challenges to successful development include incomplete understanding of viral transmission, pathogenesis and immune response (in particular at the mucosal level), no optimal animal challenge models, lack of standardized immunological assays, and insufficient sustainable funding.},

Here, we showed that induction of airway memory CD4+ T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pan-coronavirus vaccines. Airway memory CD4+ T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lung-derived cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was dependent on interferon-γ and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4+ T cells targeting conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and other respiratory virus outbreaks.},

Public outcry drives vaccine research during outbreaks of emerging infectious disease, but public support for vaccine development dries up when the outbreaks are resolved, frequently leaving promising vaccine candidates sitting on the shelf. DNA vaccines, with their potential for rapid large-scale production, may help overcome this hurdle. Muthumani et al. report the development of a synthetic DNA vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that induces neutralizing antibodies in mice, macaques, and camels—natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Indeed, macaques vaccinated with this DNA vaccine were protected from viral challenge. These promising results support further development of DNA vaccines for emerging infections.

It was demonstrated that the resultant hydrogel film could serve as a functional tissue patch with an excellent adhesion property on one surface for repairing injured tissues and an anti-adhesion property on the other surface for preventing adverse adhesion. Besides, because of the responsive structural color, the patch was imparted with self-reporting mechanical capability, which could provide a real-time color-sensing feedback to monitor the heartbeat activity. Moreover, the catechol groups on PDA imparted the patch with high tissue adhesiveness and self-healing capability in vivo. These features give the bioinspired patch high potential in biomedical applications.},

This study compared the local inflammatory reaction to commercially available BioGlue and Coseal sealants in a rabbit aorta suture hole model. Twenty male New Zealand white rabbits were randomised to testing with either BioGlue or Coseal. Two weeks after sealant application to suture holes, sections of the aorta at the puncture site, and surrounding tissue, were processed for histopathological analysis. Inflammation was graded from 0 to 3 according to tissue alteration and presence of inflammatory cells. Material stiffness was measured in vitro using compression testing. From examination of the inflammatory response to the sealants, a less severe histopathological assessment score was assigned to the Coseal compared to the BioGlue group (mean Æ SD: 1.56 Æ 0.53 vs 2.67 Æ 0.50; p ¼ 0.002). While both materials triggered a typical foreign body reaction characterised by granulomatous inflammation, BioGlue additionally provoked eosinophilic cell infiltration. Lymphocytes, plasma cells and B cells were also more prevalent in the BioGlue compared to the Coseal specimens. Coseal residue was either absent or visible in only small quantities, while significant BioGlue deposits remained in the tissue 2 weeks after application. Coseal was much more elastic than BioGlue, with a compressive modulus an order of magnitude lower (mean Æ SD: 91 Æ 41 vs 1833 Æ 297 kPa). Compared to BioGlue, Coseal elicited a less pronounced inflammatory response in the aortic and periaortic tissue in this model, and demonstrated greater elasticity.},

However, many of these hydrogels are not optimized for use in the oral environment, where they are exposed to blood and saliva. To address these challenges, we engineered an alginate-based adhesive, photocrosslinkable, and osteoconductive hydrogel biomaterial (AdhHG) with tunable mechanical properties. The engineered hydrogel was used as an injectable mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery vehicle for craniofacial bone tissue engineering applications. Subcutaneous implantation in mice confirmed the biodegradability, biocompatibility, and osteoconductivity of the hydrogel. In a well-established rat peri-implantitis model, application of the adhesive hydrogel encapsulating gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) resulted in complete bone regeneration around ailing dental implants with peri-implant bone loss. Together, we have developed a distinct bioinspired adhesive hydrogel with tunable mechanical properties and biodegradability that effectively delivers patient-derived dental-derived MSCs. The hydrogel is photocrosslinkable and, due to the presence of MSC aggregates and hydroxyapatite microparticles, promotes bone regeneration for craniofacial tissue engineering applications.},

Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.},

	abstract = {There is a clinical need for improved wound treatments that prevent both infection and excessive inflammation. TCP-25, a thrombin-derived peptide, is antibacterial and scavenges pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide, thereby preventing CD14 interaction and Toll-like receptor dimerization, leading to reduced downstream immune activation. Here, we describe the development of a hydrogel formulation that was functionalized with TCP-25 to target bacteria and associated PAMP-induced inflammation. In vitro studies determined the polymer prerequisites for such TCP-25–mediated dual action, favoring the use of noncharged hydrophilic hydrogels, which enabled peptide conformational changes and LPS binding. The TCP-25–functionalized hydrogels killed Gram-positive
              Staphylococcus aureus
              and Gram-negative
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              bacteria in vitro, as well as in experimental mouse models of subcutaneous infection. The TCP-25 hydrogel also mediated reduction of LPS-induced local inflammatory responses, as demonstrated by analysis of local cytokine production and in vivo bioimaging using nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) reporter mice. In porcine partial thickness wound models, TCP-25 prevented infection with
              S. aureus
              and reduced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Proteolytic fragmentation of TCP-25 in vitro yielded a series of bioactive TCP fragments that were identical or similar to those present in wounds in vivo. Together, the results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of TCP-25 hydrogel, a wound treatment based on the body’s peptide defense, for prevention of both bacterial infection and the accompanying inflammation.},

They are also undergoing investigation in the management of non-melanoma skin cancers. In contrast to drug or vaccine delivery, when only a small number of MAP applications would be required, hydrogel MAPs utilised for sampling purposes or for tumour eradication would necessitate regular, repeat applications. Therefore, the current study was designed to address one of the key translational aspects of MAP development, namely patient safety. We demonstrate, for the first time in human volunteers, that repeat MAP application and wear does not lead to prolonged skin reactions or prolonged disruption of skin barrier function. Importantly, concentrations of specific systemic biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP); tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)); infection (interleukin-1β (IL-1β); allergy (immunoglobulin E (IgE)) and immunity (immunoglobulin G (IgG)) were all recorded over the course of this fixed study period. No biomarker concentrations above the normal, documented adult ranges were recorded over the course of the study, indicating that no systemic reactions had been initiated in volunteers. Building upon the results of this study, which serve to highlight the safety of our hydrogel MAP, we are actively working towards CE marking of our MAP technology as a medical device.},

	abstract = {For the past few decades, tissue sealants and adhesives have been developed as an alternative to sutures and staples to close and seal wounds or incisions. These materials are advantageous because of their ease of use, short application time and minimal tissue damage, making them suitable for minimally invasive procedures. However, there is a large gap between the amount of research into tissue adhesives and the number of products available. To bridge this gap, there is a need to better understand the challenges to clinical translation of tissue adhesives. In particular, adhesive design must be informed by a deep understanding of the target tissue’s surface characteristics and environment, which vary considerably among tissue types. Moreover, understanding and monitoring the long-term performance of a material post-implantation is crucial; this includes monitoring the chemical and physical properties of the implanted adhesives over time, tissue responses and the resultant changes in adhesion and cohesion. In addition, early-stage consideration of the unmet clinical need and the regulatory and development paths could lower the barriers in the development cost and effort, facilitating clinical translation. In this Review , we identify challenges in the development of tissue adhesives and provide design criteria to translate tissue-adhesive technologies into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Designing versatile functional medical adhesives with injectability, selfhealing, and strong adhesion is of great signiﬁcance to achieve desirable therapeutic eﬀects for promoting wound sealing in healthcare. Herein, a self-healing injectable adhesive is fabricated by physical interaction of polyphenol compound tannic acid (TA) and eight-arm poly(ethylene glycol) end-capped with succinimide glutarate active ester (PEG-SG). The hydrogen bonding induced from the structural unit (−CH2−CH2−O−) of PEG and catechol hydroxyl (−OH) of TA, accompanied by ester exchange between Nhydroxysuccinimide (−NHS) and amino (−NH2) of proteins, contributes to self-healing ability and rapid strong adhesion. Notably, the PEG/TA adhesive can repeatedly adhere to rigid porcine tissues, close the coronary artery under a large incision tension, and bear a heavy load of 2 kg. By exhibiting shear-thinning and anti-swelling properties, the PEG/TA adhesive can be easily applied through single-syringe extrusion onto various wounds. The single-channel toothpaste-like feature of the adhesive ensures its storage hermetically for portable usage. Moreover, in vivo operation and histological H\&E staining results indicate that the PEG/TA adhesive greatly accelerates wound healing and tissue regeneration in a rat model. With the specialty of injectability, instant self-healing, and long-lasting strong adhesion to facilitate excellent therapeutic eﬀects, the multifunctional PEG/ TA adhesive may provide a new alternative for self-rescue and surgical situations.},

The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80\% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90\% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50\% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.},

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{t}}$) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95\% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of \textit{R}$_{\textrm{t}}$, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50\% chance the infection will establish within that population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.

We estimate 86\% of all infections were undocumented (95\% CI: [82\%–90\%]) prior to 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. Per person, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55\% of documented infections ([46\%–62\%]), yet, due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79\% of documented cases.

            Use of mRNA-based vaccines for tumour immunotherapy has gained increasing attention in recent years. A growing number of studies applying nanomedicine concepts to mRNA tumour vaccination show that the mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format can generate a more robust immune response. Advances in the past decade have deepened our understanding of gene delivery barriers, mRNA's biological stability and immunological properties, and support the notion for engineering innovations tailored towards a more efficient mRNA nanoparticle vaccine delivery system. In this review we will first examine the suitability of mRNA for engineering manipulations, followed by discussion of a model framework that highlights the barriers to a robust anti-tumour immunity mediated by mRNA encapsulated in nanoparticles. Finally, by consolidating existing literature on mRNA nanoparticle tumour vaccination within the context of this framework, we aim to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed by future nanoengineering research.},

	abstract = {Intracellular delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) has the potential to induce protein production for many therapeutic applications. Although lipid nanoparticles have shown considerable promise for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), their utility as agents for mRNA delivery has only recently been investigated. The most common siRNA formulations contain four components: an amine-containing lipid or lipid-like material, phospholipid, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol, the relative ratios of which can have profound eﬀects on the formulation potency. Here, we develop a generalized strategy to optimize lipid nanoparticle formulations for mRNA delivery to the liver in vivo using Design of Experiment (DOE) methodologies including Deﬁnitive Screening and Fractional Factorial Designs. By simultaneously varying lipid ratios and structures, we developed an optimized formulation which increased the potency of erythropoietin-mRNA-loaded C12-200 lipid nanoparticles 7-fold relative to formulations previously used for siRNA delivery. Key features of this optimized formulation were the incorporation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and increased ionizable lipid:mRNA weight ratios. Interestingly, the optimized lipid nanoparticle formulation did not improve siRNA delivery, indicating diﬀerences in optimized formulation parameter design spaces for siRNA and mRNA. We believe the general method described here can accelerate in vivo screening and optimization of nanoparticle formulations with large multidimensional design spaces.},

          , 
            Onpattro, the first RNAi-based therapeutic to receive FDA approval, is enabled by a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system that facilitates siRNA delivery into the cytoplasm of target cells (hepatocytes) following intravenous (i.v.) administration. These LNP-siRNA systems consist of four lipid components (ionizable cationic lipid, distearolyphosphatidycholine or DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid) and siRNA. The ionizable cationic lipid has been optimised for RNA encapsulation and intracellular delivery, and the PEG-lipids have been engineered to regulate LNP size and transfection potency. The roles of the other “helper” lipids, DSPC and cholesterol, remain less clear. Here we show that in empty LNP systems that do not contain siRNA, DSPC–cholesterol resides in outer layers, whereas in loaded systems a portion of the DSPC–cholesterol is internalised together with siRNA. It is concluded that the presence of internalised helper lipid is vital to the stable encapsulation of siRNA in the LNP and thus to LNP-siRNA function.},

In this study, we begin to assess the potential utility of 2؅-modified siRNAs in mammals. We demonstrate that siRNA modified with 2؅-flouro (2؅-F) pyrimidines are functional in cell culture and have a greatly increased stability and a prolonged half-life in human plasma as compared to 2؅-OH containing siRNAs. Moreover, we show that the 2؅-F containing siRNAs are functional in mice and can inhibit the expression of a target gene in vivo. However, even though the modified siRNAs have greatly increased resistance to nuclease degradation in plasma, this increase in stability did not translate into enhanced or prolonged inhibitory activity of target gene reduction in mice following tail vein injection. Thus, this study shows that 2؅-F modified siRNAs are functional in vivo, but that they are not necessarily more potent than unmodified siRNAs in animals.},

Here, we report a potent and safe lipid nanoparticle with long-term storage stability. Through chemical synthesis and screening of cationic lipids, a formulation has been identiﬁed that enables potent knockdown of hepatocyte proteins in mice upon intravenous administration (siRNA ED50 {\textasciitilde}0.02 mg/kg). Toxicity studies revealed that a dose of 2 mg/kg was well tolerated in rats, the most sensitive rodent model. We identiﬁed that a cyclic chemical structure in cationic lipids improved particle stability. The nanoparticles showed over 1.5 year storage stability as a liquid, with over 90\% siRNA encapsulation without any changes in particle size. This novel delivery material has promising potential as a drug product that could bring RNA therapeutics to the treatment of liver-related disorders.},

Despite high silencing efﬁciency and on-target speciﬁcity, the clinical translation of siRNA has been hindered by its inherent features: poor intracellular delivery, limited blood stability, unpredictable immune responses and unwanted off-targeting effects. To overcome these hindrances, researchers have made various advances to modify siRNA itself and to improve its delivery. In this review paper, ﬁrst we brieﬂy discuss the innate properties and delivery barriers of siRNA. Then, we describe recent progress in (1) chemically and structurally modiﬁed siRNAs to solve their intrinsic problems and (2) siRNA delivery formulations including siRNA conjugates, polymerized siRNA, and nucleic acid-based nanoparticles to improve in vivo delivery.},

Nucleotide vaccines, including mRNA vaccines with their intracellular antigen synthesis, have been shown to be potent activators of a cytotoxic immune response. The intracellular delivery of mRNA vaccines to the cytosol of antigen presenting immune cells is still not suﬃciently well understood. Here, we report on the development of a lipid nanoparticle formulation for the delivery of mRNA vaccines to induce a cytotoxic CD 8 T cell response. We show transfection of dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The eﬃcacy of the vaccine was tested in an aggressive B16F10 melanoma model. We found a strong CD 8 T cell activation after a single immunization. Treatment of B16F10 melanoma tumors with lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA coding for the tumor-associated antigens gp100 and TRP2 resulted in tumor shrinkage and extended the overall survival of the treated mice. The immune response can be further increased by the incorporation of the adjuvant LPS. In conclusion, the lipid nanoparticle formulation presented here is a promising vector for mRNA vaccine delivery, one that is capable of inducing a strong cytotoxic T cell response. Further optimization, including the incorporation of diﬀerent adjuvants, will likely enhance the potency of the vaccine.},

Specifically, we study how the tail length, tail geometry, and linker spacing in diketopiperazine lipid materials influences LNP potency with siRNAs and mRNAs. Eight lipid materials are synthesized, and 16 total formulations are screened for activity in vitro; the lead material is evaluated with mRNA for in vivo use and demonstrates luciferase protein expression in the spleen. In undertaking this approach, not only do we develop synthetic routes to delivery materials, but we also reveal structural criteria that could be useful for developing next-generation delivery materials for RNA therapeutics.},

Here, we demonstrate that N1-methyl-pseudouridine (N1m ) outperforms several other nucleoside modiﬁcations and their combinations in terms of translation capacity. Through extensive analysis of various modiﬁed transcripts in cell-free translation systems, we deconvolute the different components of the effect on protein expression independent of mRNA stability mechanisms. We show that in addition to turning off the immune/eIF2␣ phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of translation, the incorporated N1m nucleotides dramatically alter the dynamics of the translation process by increasing ribosome pausing and density on the mRNA. Our results indicate that the increased ribosome loading of modiﬁed mRNAs renders them more permissive for initiation by favoring either ribosome recycling on the same mRNA or de novo ribosome recruitment.},

Because of the ineﬃciencies of current formulation methods, materials are usually ﬁrst evaluated for in vitro delivery eﬃcacy as simple ionic complexes with the nucleic acids (lipoplexes). The predictive value of such assays, however, has never been systematically studied. Here, for the ﬁrst time, by developing a microﬂuidic method that allowed the rapid preparation of high-quality siRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for a large number of materials, we have shown that gene silencing assays employing lipoplexes result in a high rate of false negatives (∼90\%) that can largely be avoided through formulation. Seven novel materials with in vivo gene silencing potencies of {\textgreater}90\% at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg in mice were discovered. This method will facilitate the discovery of next-generation reagents for LNP-mediated nucleic acid delivery.},

Synthetic nanoparticle vectors composed of poly(bamino esters) (PBAEs) and nucleic acids have previously demonstrated potential utility for local delivery applications. To expand this potential utility to include systemic delivery of mRNA, hybrid polymer–lipid nanoformulations for systemic delivery to the lungs were developed. Through coformulation of PBAEs with lipid–polyethylene glycol (PEG), mRNA formulations were developed with increased serum stability and increased in vitro potency. The formulations were capable of functional delivery of mRNA to the lungs after intravenous administration in mice.

Consequently, nanosized lipid carriers have been utilized for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to improve their efficacy in clinical studies. In this review, we attempt to elaborate on the current improvements of chemically diverse lipid carriers for the delivery of siRNAsbased drugs across a wide range of diseases.

	abstract = {Conventional oral therapy of lymphatic filariasis drugs is only effective to kill microfilariae in the bloodstream, but is often ineffective to kill adult filarial (macrofilariae) in the complex anatomy of the lymphatic system. The encapsulation of drugs into lipid-based nanoparticles with sizes of {\textless} 100 nm, and administration intradermally, could be used to enhance lymphatic uptake. Therefore, we developed an innovative approach, using solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and dissolving microneedles (MNs) to deliver antifilariasis drugs, namely doxycycline, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole, intradermally. The SLNs were prepared from Geleol® and Tween®80 as a lipid matrix and stabilizer, respectively. The formulations were optimized using a central composite design, producing SLNs with sizes of {\textless} 100 nm. Drug release was sustained over 48 h from SLNs, compared to pure drugs. The SLNs were then incorporated into a polymeric hydrogel which was casted to form SLNs-loaded MNs. SLNs-loaded MNs exhibited sufficient mechanical and insertion properties. Importantly, dermatokinetic studies showed that {\textgreater} 40\% of drugs were retained in the dermis of excised neonatal porcine skin up to 24 h post-MN application, indicating the high possibility of the SLNs to be taken by the lymphatic system. In in vivo studies, the maximal lymph concentrations of the three drugs in rat, achieved following intradermal delivery, ranged between 4- and 7-fold higher than that recorded after oral administration. Additionally, compared to oral administration, despite the lower plasma Cmax and organ-distribution, the AUC and relative bioavailability of the three drugs in rat plasma was also higher using our delivery approach. Accordingly, this delivery approach could maximize the drugs concentrations in the lymph system without essentially increasing their plasma concentrations. This could potentially deliver the drugs efficiently to the bloodstream, where the microfilariae reside, while also targeting drug to the lymph nodes, where filarial nematodes reside in infected patients, leading to an effective therapy for lymphatic filariasis.},

In both species, modified mRNA encoding the protein for human erythropoietin (hEPO) had predictable and consistent pharmacologic and toxicologic effects. Pharmacokinetic analysis conducted following the first dose showed that measured hEPO levels were maximal at 6 hours after the end of intravenous infusion and in excess of 100fold the anticipated efficacious exposure (17.6 ng/ml) at the highest dose tested.24 hEPO was pharmacologically active in both the rat and the monkey, as indicated by a significant increase in red blood cell mass parameters. The primary safety-related findings were caused by the exaggerated pharmacology of hEPO and included increased hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow (rats) and minimal hemorrhage in the heart (monkeys). Additional primary safety-related findings in the rat included mildly increased white blood cell counts, changes in the coagulation parameters at all doses, as well as liver injury and release of interferon g–inducible protein 10 in high-dose groups only. In the monkey, as seen with the parenteral administration of cationic LNPs, splenic necrosis and lymphocyte depletion were observed, accompanied with mild and reversible complement activation. These findings defined a well-tolerated dose level above the anticipated efficacious dose. Overall, these combined studies indicate that LNP-formulated modified mRNA can be administered by intravenous infusion in 2 toxicologically relevant test species and generate supratherapeutic levels of protein (hEPO) in vivo.},

The LNPs used here were synthesized by the microﬂuidic mixing technique and are composed of ionizable cationic lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), a phospholipid (distearoylphosphatidylcholine, DSPC), cholesterol, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (dimyristoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DMPE)−PEG 2000), as well as encapsulated cargoes that are either phosphorothioated siRNA (50 or 100\%) or mRNA. We show that LNPs form physically stable complexes with bioactive drug siRNA for a period of 94 days. Relayed DNP experiments are performed to study 1H−1H spin diﬀusion and to determine the spatial location of the various components of the LNP by studying the average enhancement factors as a function of polarization time. We observe a striking feature of LNPs in the presence and in the absence of encapsulating siRNA or mRNA by comparing our experimental results to numerical spin-diﬀusion modeling. We observe that LNPs form a layered structure, and we detect that DSPC and DMPE−PEG 2000 lipids form a surface rich layer in the presence (or absence) of the cargoes and that the cholesterol and ionizable cationic lipid are embedded in the core. Furthermore, relayed DNP 31P solid-state NMR experiments allow the location of the cargo encapsulated in the LNPs to be determined. On the basis of the results, we propose a new structural model for the LNPs that features a homogeneous core with a tendency for layering of DSPC and DMPE−PEG at the surface.},

	abstract = {Intracellular delivery of mRNA holds great potential for vaccine1−3 and therapeutic4 discovery and development. Despite increasing recognition of the utility of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) for intracellular delivery of mRNA, particle engineering is hindered by insuﬃcient understanding of endosomal escape, which is believed to be a main limiter of cytosolic availability and activity of the nucleic acid inside the cell. Using a series of CRISPR-based genetic perturbations of the lysosomal pathway, we have identiﬁed that late endosome/lysosome (LE/Ly) formation is essential for functional delivery of exogenously presented mRNA. Lysosomes provide a spatiotemporal hub to orchestrate mTOR signaling and are known to control cell proliferation, nutrient sensing, ribosomal biogenesis, and mRNA translation. Through modulation of the mTOR pathway we were able to enhance or inhibit LNP-mediated mRNA delivery. To further boost intracellular delivery of mRNA, we screened 212 bioactive lipid-like molecules that are either enriched in vesicular compartments or modulate cell signaling. Surprisingly, we have discovered that leukotriene-antagonists, clinically approved for treatment of asthma and other lung diseases, enhance intracellular mRNA delivery in vitro (over 3-fold, p {\textless} 0.005) and in vivo (over 2-fold, p {\textless} 0.005). Understanding LNP-mediated intracellular delivery will inspire the next generation of RNA therapeutics that have high potency and limited toxicity.},

	abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a promising tool for biotherapeutics, and self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) is particularly advantageous, because it results in abundant protein expression and production is easily scalable. While mRNA therapeutics have been shown to be highly eﬀective in small animals, the outcomes do not scale linearly when these formulations are translated to dose-escalation studies in humans. Here, we utilize a design of experiments (DoE) approach to optimize the formulation of saRNA lipid nanoparticles in human skin explants. We ﬁrst observed that luciferase expression from saRNA peaked after 11 days in human skin. Using DoE inputs of complexing lipid identity, lipid nanoparticle dose, lipid concentration, particle concentration, and ratio of zwitterionic to cationic lipids, we optimized the saRNA-induced luciferase expression in skin explants. Lipid identity and lipid concentration were found to be signiﬁcant parameters in the DoE model, and the optimized formulation resulted in ∼7-fold increase in luciferase expression, relative to initial 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) formulation. Using ﬂow cytometry, we observed that optimized formulations delivered the saRNA to ∼2\% of the resident cells in the human skin explants. Although immune cells comprise only 7\% of the total population of cells in skin, immune cells were found to express ∼50\% of the RNA. This study demonstrates the powerful combination of using a DoE approach paired with clinically relevant human skin explants to optimize nucleic acid formulations. We expect that this system will be useful for optimizing both formulation and molecular designs of clinically translational nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics.},

In this study excised human skin explants were used to investigate and optimise key parameters that will determine stable and effective microneedle-facilitated pDNA delivery. These include (i) high dose-loading of pDNA onto microneedle surfaces, (ii) stability and functionality of the coated pDNA, (iii) skin penetration capability of pDNA-coated microneedles, and (iv) efﬁcient gene expression in human skin. Optimisation of a dip-coating method enabled signiﬁcant increases in the loading capacity, up to 100 μg of pDNA per 5-microneedle array. Coated microneedles were able to reproducibly perforate human skin at low (b 1 N) insertion forces. The physical stability of the coated pDNA was partially compromised on storage, although this was improved through the addition of saccharide excipients without detriment to the biological functionality of pDNA. The pDNA-coated microneedles facilitated reporter gene expression in viable human skin. The efﬁciency of gene expression from coated microneedles will depend upon suitable DNA loading, efﬁcient and reproducible skin puncture and rapid in situ dissolution of the plasmid at the site of delivery.},

	abstract = {In this study we present polymeric microneedles composed of multiple layers to control drug release kinetics. Layered microneedles were fabricated by spraying poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in sequence, and were characterized by mechanical testing and ex vivo skin insertion tests. The compression test demonstrated that no noticeable layer separation occurred, indicating good adhesion between PLGA and PVP layers. Histological examination conﬁrmed that the microneedles were successfully inserted into the skin and indicated biphasic release of dyes incorporated within microneedle matrices. Structural changes of a model protein drug, bovine serum albumin (BSA), in PLGA and PVP matrices were examined by circular dichroism (CD) and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that the tertiary structure of BSA was well maintained in both PLGA and PVP layers while the secondary structures were slightly changed during microneedle fabrication. In vitro release studies showed that over 60\% of BSA in the PLGA layer was released within 1 h, followed by continuous slow release over the course of the experiments (7 days), while BSA in the PVP layer was completely released within 0.5 h. The initial burst of BSA from PLGA was further controlled by depositing a blank PLGA layer prior to forming the PLGA layer containing BSA. The blank PLGA layer acted as a diffusion barrier, resulting in a reduced initial burst. The formation of the PLGA diffusion barrier was visualized using confocal microscopy. Our results suggest that the spray-formed multilayer microneedles could be an attractive transdermal drug delivery system that is capable of modulating a drug release proﬁle.},

As such, there is a critical need for a robust, thermally stable IPV to support global polio eradication and post-eradication immunization needs. Here, we present the development of air-dried thin ﬁlms for temperature stabilization of IPV using the biomaterial silk ﬁbroin. Thin-ﬁlm product compositions were optimized for physical properties as well as poliovirus Dantigen recovery and were tested under accelerated and real-time stability storage conditions. Silk ﬁbroin IPV ﬁlms maintained 70\% D-antigen potency after storage for nearly three years at room temperature, and greater than 50\% potency for IPV-2 and IPV-3 serotypes at 45 °C for one year. The immunogenicity of silk ﬁbroin IPV ﬁlms after 2-week storage at 45 °C was assessed in Wistar rats and the stressed ﬁlms generated equivalent neutralizing antibody responses to commercial vaccine for IPV-1 and IPV-2. However, the absence of IPV-3 responses warrants further investigation into the speciﬁcity of ELISA for intact IPV-3 D-antigen. By demonstrating immunogenicity post-storage, we offer the air-dried silk ﬁlm format as a means to increase IPV vaccine access through innovative delivery systems such as microneedles.},

Herein, we report microneedle patch (MNP) as an alternative to the oral route for the systemic delivery of tacrolimus (TM), an immunosuppressant drug. Thiolated chitosan (TCS) based microneedle patch was fabricated and characterized in vitro and in vivo for its mechanical strength, skin penetration, drug release, and skin irritation. The MNP having 225 needles with 575 μm showed good mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength and percentage elongation. The skin penetration showed 84\% penetration with no breakage. Histology of the mice skin after insertion showed the penetration of needles into the dermis. In vitro release and ex vivo permeation studies through Franz diffusion cell showed the sustained release (82.5\%) of TM from the MNP with signiﬁcantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) skin permeation as compared with controls, respectively.

Thus, the TCS microneedle patch has the potential to be developed as a transdermal delivery system for tacrolimus with improved bioavailability and sustained release over a longer period.},

Microneedle (MN)-based devices have gained signiﬁcant interest as a strategy to overcome the skin’s formidable barrier: the stratum corneum. This approach provides a less invasive, more efﬁcient, patient friendly method of drug delivery with the ability to incorporate various therapeutic agents including macromolecules (proteins and peptides), anti-cancer agents and other hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. This short review attempts to assess the various materials involved in the fabrication of MNs as well as incorporation of other excipients to improve drug delivery for novel medical devices. The focus will be on polymers, metals and other inorganic materials utilised for MN drug delivery, as well as their application, limitations and future work to be carried out.},

However, current DMN fabrication methods involve a reconstitution process of the therapeutics, which can result in degradation of the therapeutics or limited loading capacity for a reasonable application size. In the present study, we developed self-administrative powder-carrying microneedles (PCMs), lacking a reconstitution step, which implant insulin powder directly inside the skin without using a sticky patch. Compared with DMNs in the same geometries, the PCMs delivered the required dose in a more condensed form without considering insulin solubility and degradation during the fabrication process. Moreover, PCMs showed enhanced long-term stability and prolonged release kinetics, which could be utilized to treat diabetes without apparent safety issues. This implantable PCM technique will greatly impact the future of transdermal drug delivery systems because it is applicable to any type of therapeutic available in a dry powder formulation for a wide variety of biomedical applications.},

These platforms have been proven to increase transdermal drug delivery efﬁciency dramatically by penetrating restrictive tissue barriers in a minimally invasive manner. While much of the early development of MNs focused on transdermal drug delivery, this technology can be applied to a variety of other non-transdermal biomedical applications. Several variations, such as multi-layer or hollow MNs, have been developed to cater to the needs of speciﬁc applications. The heterogeneity in the design of MNs has demanded similar variety in their fabrication methods; the most common methods include micromolding and drawing lithography. Numerous materials have been explored for MN fabrication which range from biocompatible ceramics and metals to natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers. Recent advances in MN engineering have diversiﬁed MNs to include unique shapes, materials, and mechanical properties that can be tailored for organ-speciﬁc applications. In this review, we discuss the design and creation of modern MNs that aim to surpass the biological barriers of non-transdermal drug delivery in ocular, vascular, oral, and mucosal tissue.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) has considerable potential as therapy or vaccine for a range of lung diseases. Inhaled dry powder formulation of mRNA is particularly attractive as it has superior stability and dry powder inhaler is relatively easy to use. A safe and eﬀective mRNA delivery vector as well as a suitable particle engineering method are required to produce a dry powder formulation that is respirable and mediates robust transfection in the lung. Here, we introduce a novel RNA delivery vector, PEG12KL4, in which the synthetic cationic KL4 peptide is attached to a monodisperse linear PEG of 12-mers. The PEG12KL4 formed nanosized complexes with mRNA at 10:1 ratio (w/w) and mediated eﬀective transfection on human lung epithelial cells. PEG12KL4/mRNA complexes were successfully formulated into dry powder by spray drying (SD) and spray freeze drying (SFD) techniques. Both SD and SFD powder exhibited satisfactory aerosol properties for inhalation. More importantly, the biological activity of the PEG12KL4 /mRNA complexes were successfully preserved after drying. Using luciferase mRNA, the intratracheal administration of the liquid or powder aerosol of PEG12KL4 /mRNA complexes at a dose of 5 μg mRNA resulted in luciferase expression in the deep lung region of mice 24 h post-transfection. The transfection eﬃciency was superior to naked mRNA or lipoplexes (Lipofectamine 2000), in which luciferase expression was weaker and restricted to the tracheal region only. There was no sign of inﬂammatory response or toxicity of the PEG12KL4 /mRNA complexes after single intratracheal administration. Overall, PEG12KL4 is an excellent mRNA transfection agent for pulmonary delivery. This is also the ﬁrst study that successfully demonstrates the preparation of inhalable dry powder mRNA formulations with in vivo transfection eﬃciency, showing the great promise of PEG12KL4 peptide as a mRNA delivery vector candidate for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {The broadest clinical application of siRNA therapeutics will be facilitated by drug-loaded delivery systems that maintain stability and potency for long times under ambient conditions. In the present study, we seek to better understand the stability and effect of storage conditions on lipidoid nanoparticles (LNPs), which have been previously shown by our group and others to potently deliver RNA to various cell and organ targets both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, this study evaluates the influence of pH, temperature, and lyophilization on LNP efficacy in HeLa cells. When stored under aqueous conditions, we found that refrigeration (2°C) kept LNPs the most stable over 150 days compared to storage in the -20°C freezer or at room temperature. Because the pH of the storage buffer was not found to influence stability, it is suggested that the LNPs be stored under physiologically appropriate conditions (pH 7) for ease of use. Although aggregation and loss of efficacy were observed when LNPs were subjected to freeze–thaw cycles, their stability was retained with the use of the cryoprotectants, trehalose, and sucrose. Initially, lyophilization of the LNPs followed by reconstitution in aqueous buffer also led to reductions in efficacy, most likely due to aggregation upon reconstitution. Although the addition of ethanol to the reconstitution buffer restored efficacy, this approach is not ideal, as LNP solutions would require dialysis prior to use. Fortunately, we found that the addition of trehalose or sucrose to LNP solutions prior to lyophilization facilitated room temperature storage and reconstitution in aqueous buffer without diminishing delivery potency.},

In the present work, the effect of lyophilization on the morphological characteristics and transfection capacity of solid lipid nanoparticles (LyoSLN) and SLN-DNA vectors (Lyo(SLN-DNA)) has been evaluated. The lyophilized preparations were stored under three different sets of temperature and humidity ICH conditions: 25 °C/60\%RH, 30 °C/65\%RH and 40 °C/75\%RH. After lyophilization we found an increase in particle size which did not imply a reduction of ‘‘in vitro” transfection capacity. Stability studies of formulations lyophilized with trehalose showed that SLNs were physically stable during 9 months at 25 °C/60\%RH and 6 months at 30 °C/65\%RH. This stability was lost when harder conditions were employed (40 °C/75\%RH). LyoSLNs maintained or increased the transfection efﬁcacy (from 19\% to approximately 40\% EGFP positive cells) over time only at 25 °C/60\%RH and 30 °C/65\%RH. Lyo(SLN-DNA) resulted in almost no transfection under all conditions. LyoSLNs showed less DNA condensation capacity, whereas in Lyo(SLN-DNA) the plasmid became strongly bound, hampering the transfection. Furthermore, the storage of lyophilized lipoplexes stabilized with the disaccharide trehalose did not affect cell viability.},

We used three types of cationic cholesterol derivatives and three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids for the preparation of cationic liposomes, and we prepared six types of freeze-dried siRNA lipoplexes in the presence of trehalose or sucrose solution in multi-well plates. Increasing concentrations of trehalose or sucrose included during freeze-drying of siRNA lipoplexes resulted in increased gene silencing activity upon Rev-transfection. Strong gene silencing activity was observed regardless of the type of cationic lipid in cationic liposomes when siRNA lipoplexes were freeze-dried with the disaccharides at concentrations of more than 25 mM or 100 mM. In addition, siRNA lipoplexes freeze-dried with 100 mM trehalose or sucrose showed long-term (1 month) stability without apparent loss of gene silencing activity. These findings suggested that Rev-transfection with freeze-dried siRNA lipoplexes may have potential applications in the screening of gene function using siRNA libraries.},

	abstract = {Background
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus is a member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family that first appeared in the Guangdong Province of China in 2002 and was recognized as an emerging infectious disease in March 2003. Over 8000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study.
Methods
A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays.
Results
The vaccine was well tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in all vaccinees, and CD8+ T-cell responses in ∼20\% of individuals.
Conclusions
The VRC SARS DNA vaccine was well tolerated and produced cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody in healthy adults.},

	abstract = {Background
Development an effective vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is urgent and limited information is available on vaccination in nonhuman primate (NHP) model. We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model.
Methods
Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests.
Conclusion
Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys. These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection.},

Evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine. Using antibodies from SARS patients, we identified and characterized SARS-CoV B-cell peptide epitopes with disparate functions. In rhesus macaques, the spike glycoprotein peptides S471–503, S604–625, and S1164–1191 elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates. In contrast, peptide S597–603 induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates by using an epitope sequence-dependent (ESD) mechanism. This peptide exhibited a high level of serological reactivity (64\%), which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem epitopes (S597–603 and S604–625) and a long-term human B-cell memory response with antisera from convalescent SARS patients. Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S597–603 epitope. We provide herein an alternative strategy to prepare a safe and effective vaccine for ADE of viral infection by identifying and eliminating epitope sequence-dependent enhancement of viral infection.},

Lung mononuclear infiltrates occurred in all groups after virus challenge but with increased infiltrates that contained eosinophils and increases in the eosinophil promoting IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines only in the vaccine groups.

	abstract = {The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic betacoronavirus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe acute respiratory disease. As of July 28, 2017, there have been 2,040 confirmed cases with 712 reported deaths. While many infections have been fatal, there have also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing. New Zealand white rabbits are a possible model for asymptomatic infection with MERS-CoV. In order to discover more about non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with MERS-CoV would protect against reinfection, we inoculated rabbits with MERS-CoV and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response. Following intranasal infection, rabbits developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral RNA, viral antigen, and perivascular inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs. The rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the animals were not protected from reinfection. In fact, reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without an associated increase in viral RNA titers. Interestingly, passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to naïve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection. We further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection. However, reinfection elicited neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge. Our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to MERS-CoV who fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response, or persons whose neutralizing antibody titers have waned, may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure to MERS-CoV.},

	abstract = {Background
High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was developed to improve antibody responses to influenza vaccine in the elderly and hence potentially impact favorably on influenza-associated morbidity and mortality in this population.
Methods
A phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted to compare High-Dose (HD) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (60μg of hemagglutinin [HA] per strain) to standard dose (SD) vaccine (15μg of HA per strain) in adults ≥65 years of age. Assessments of safety (serious adverse events [SAE]), immunogenicity (hemagglutination inhibition [HAI] titers) and relative efficacy were performed during the 2009–2010 influenza season, which coincided with the H1N1 pandemic.
Results
A total of 9172 participants were enrolled in 99 research centers in the US (6117 and 3055 randomized to the HD and SD groups, respectively). Within 180 days after vaccination, 6.7\% and 6.5\% of participants in the HD and SD vaccine groups, respectively, experienced at least one SAE, of which 0.4\% and 0.3\% had a fatal outcome. A total of 0.5\% of participants in both groups discontinued the study due to a SAE. Post-vaccination HAI titers and rate of post-vaccination HAI titer ≥1:40 were significantly higher in the HD group. No cases of influenza caused by viral types/subtypes similar to those in the vaccines were observed. All cases genetically or antigenically characterized were classified as similar to influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the pandemic strain. The vaccine efficacy of HD vaccine relative to SD vaccine against any influenza viral type/subtype was 12.6\% (95\% CI −140.5; 65.8) in the intent-to-treat analysis.
Conclusion
High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and well tolerated and provides superior immune responses compared to standard dose vaccine. Demonstration of a superior vaccine efficacy requires a separate large randomized, controlled trial.},

Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to be a public health emergency of international concern. The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein, making this protein a key target for potential therapies and diagnostics. Wrapp et al. determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the 2019-nCoV trimeric spike protein by cryo–electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays, the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–CoV to their common host cell receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein. These studies provide valuable information to guide the development of medical counter-measures for 2019-nCoV.

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.
The overall structure of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein resembles that of SARS-CoV S, but 2019-nCoV S binds more tightly to the host receptor.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative adhesions are a significant problem after colorectal surgery. However, the basic epidemiology and clinical burden are unknown. The Surgical and Clinical Adhesions Research Study has investigated the scale of the problem in a population of 5 million. METHODS: Validated data from the Scottish National Health Service Medical Record Linkage Database were used to define a cohort of 12,584 patients undergoing open lower abdominal surgery in 1986. Readmissions for potential adhesion-related disease in the subsequent ten years were analyzed. The methodology was conservative in interpreting adhesion-related disease. RESULTS: In the study cohort 32.6 percent of patients were readmitted a mean of 2.2 times in the subsequent ten years for a potential adhesion-related problem. Although 25.4 percent of readmissions were in the first postoperative year, they continued steadily throughout the study period. After open lower abdominal surgery 7.3 percent (643) of readmissions (8,861) were directly related to adhesions. This varied according to operation site: colon (7.1 percent), rectum (8.8 percent), and small intestine (7.6 percent). The readmission rate was assessed to provide an indicator of relative risk of adhesion-related problems after initial surgery. The overall average rate of readmissions was 70.4 per 100 initial operations, with 5.1 directly related to adhesions. This rose to 116.4 and 116.5, respectively, after colonic or rectal surgery—with 8.2 and 10.3 directly related to adhesions. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high relative risk of adhesion-related problems after open lower abdominal surgery and a correspondingly high workload associated with these readmissions. This is influenced by the initial site of surgery, colon and rectum having both the greatest impact on workload and highest relative risk of directly adhesion-related problems. The study provides sound justification for improved adhesion prevention strategies.},

	volume = {83},
	issn = {0029-7844},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a novel resorbable hydrogel barrier for preventing postoperative adhesions in animals.
METHODS: A hydrogel barrier was formed in situ by photopolymerizing a solution of a macromolecular prepolymer in buffered saline using long-wavelength ultraviolet light. Two models in the rat were evaluated. In a primary adhesion model, devascularization and serosal injury were performed on the uterine horns using bipolar electrocautery. The prepolymer solution was applied to the horns and illuminated to form the barrier. On the seventh postoperative day, the fraction of the length of the horns involved in adhesions was scored, as was the quality of the adhesions. In a readhesion model, adhesions were formed as described and were surgically lysed on the seventh day, then were treated subsequently with the barrier and scored after 7 additional days. Each group in both models consisted of seven animals per treatment condition. Four prepolymer concentrations were examined in the primary adhesion model, and the optimal one was examined in the readhesion model.
RESULTS: A conformal hydrogel barrier coating was formed upon in situ photopolymerization and adhered to the treated tissues. No residual hydrogel barrier was observed 7 days after application of the optimal gel concentrations. In the primary adhesion model, the mean fraction of the horns involved in adhesions was reduced significantly, from 76\% in controls to 10\% (P {\textless} .0001), and treatment with a 10\% solution of prepolymer was determined to be optimal (P = .025). In the readhesion model, surgical lysis of adhesions alone did not reduce adhesions significantly (from 86\% to 79\%; P = .3), whereas lysis with barrier treatment did (79\% to 28\%; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: In situ photopolymerization allowed the formation of adherent, conformal barriers, which demonstrated high efficacy in the prevention of adhesion formation and reformation in animals. This efficacy and ease of use warrant clinical evaluation.},

Ileal pouch–anal anastomosis, open colectomy, and open gynecologic procedures are associated with the highest risk of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (class I evidence). Based on expert opinion (class III evidence) intraoperative preventative principles, such as meticulous hemostasis, avoiding excessive tissue dissection and ischemia, and reducing remaining surgical material have been published. Laparoscopic techniques, with the exception of appendicitis, result in fewer adhesions than open techniques (class I evidence). Available bioabsorbable barriers, such as hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose and icodextrin 4\% solution, have been shown to reduce adhesions (class I evidence).
Conclusions
Postoperative adhesions are a significant health problem with major implications on quality of life and health care. General intraoperative preventative techniques, laparoscopic techniques, and the use of bioabsorbable mechanical barriers in the appropriate cases reduce the incidence and severity of peritoneal adhesions.},

	abstract = {Postoperative adhesion development remains a very frequent occurrence, which is often unrecognized by surgeons because of limited ability to conduct early second-look laparoscopies. The consequences include infertility, pelvic pain, bowel obstruction, and difficult reoperative procedures. To date, approaches to limit adhesions primarily have involved barriers to separate tissue during reepithelization. Future progress in regulating adhesion development and tissue fibrosis likely will require an improved understanding of the molecular processes involved in normal peritoneal repair and its aberrations leading to adhesion development. We hypothesize that tissue hypoxia (in part resulting from tissue incision, fulguration, suture ligation, etc.) is the major inciting event, which leads to a coordinated series of molecular events that promote an inflammatory response leading to enhanced tissue fibrosis. These events are reduced plasminogen activator activity, extracellular matrix deposition, increased cytokine production, increased angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis (programmed cell death). Improved understanding of these events and their regulation will provide the opportunity to regulate better postoperative adhesion development and tissue fibrosis, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality they cause.},

Drying alone had little effect; drying plus bleeding consistently produced adhesions to the dried area. Fresh blood alone produced adhesions between the three membranous structures [omentum and pelvic fat bodies (PFBs)]. The formation of persistent adhesions required whole blood. Preformed clots above a critical size induced adhesions even without previous serosal injury; they were usually captured by the omentum and PFBs. If all three membranous structures were excised, the clots caused visceral adhesions. The protective role of the omentum, its structure, and the mechanism of omental adhesions, are discussed. These findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of post-operative adhesions in man.},

A large number of compounds have been suggested to prevent such adhesions, but none is generally accepted. We have compared eight different substances that could be beneficial for the prevention of postoperative adhesions in a new standardized rabbit model with measurement of the areas of adhesion. In 10 groups of 20 rabbits an area of abrasion of the serosa of the ileum, the appendix, and the abdominal wall measuring 10,000 mm2 was created by an emery piston during celiotomy. The controls received no medication. The treatment groups received a single intraperitoneal administration of 1 ml per 100g body wt of normal saline (NaCl), 5 mg taurolidine (T), 0.5 U plasmin/300 U DNase (PD), 2000 IU streptokinase/500 IU streptodornase (SS), 7 mg phosphatidylcholine (PC), 4 mg hyaluronic acid (HA), 7 mg sphingolipid (SL), 7 mg galactolipid (GL), or 0.5 ml tetrachlorodecaoxide (TCDO), respectively. Ten days later the extent of adhesions was quantified by morphometry. The total area of adhesions (±SEM) was found to be 1998 ± 124 mm2 in controls. The application of NaCl reduced the adhesions to 1368 ± 58 mm2, of T to 1012 ± 48 mm2, of PD to 673 ± 33 mm2, of SS to 360 ± 44 mm2, of PC to 335 ± 84 mm2, of HA to 328 ± 76 mm2, of SL to 278 ± 80 mm2, of GL to 261 ± 67 mm2, and of TCDO to 240 ± 45 mm2. The effects of PD, SS, PC, HA, SL, GL, and TCDO were significant in comparison to controls and NaCl. Our experimental data suggest that the two new lipid substances, SL and GL, are the most likely candidates for routine clinical use in the prevention of postsurgical adhesions.},

All admissions over a 2-year period for ASBO at two district general hospitals were identified through ICD10 diagnostic codes. Diagnostic investigations, treatment patterns, ward stay and outcome information for admissions were detailed from clinical records to develop mean cost estimates and assess the associated workload. Of the 298 admissions identified, 188 were not due to ASBO and were excluded from analysis. Of the 110 admissions detailed, 41 (37\%) were treated surgically and 69 (63\%) conservatively. Most admissions occurred through general practitioner referral (86.4\%) to accident and emergency (90.0\%). Mean (SD) length of stay was 16.3 days (11.0 days) for surgical treatment and 7.0 days (4.6 days) for conservative treatment. In-patient mortality was 9.8\% for the surgical group and 7.2\% for the conservative group. Costs were based on the mean values from both centres for surgical and conservative admissions and detailed according to the cost of referral and follow-up (100.98 Pounds surgical versus 102.61 Pounds conservative), hospital ward and ICU stay (3,327.48 Pounds versus 1,267.92 Pounds), theatre time (832.32 Pounds surgical only), investigations (282.73 Pounds versus 207.33 Pounds) and drug costs (133.90 Pounds versus 28.29 Pounds). Total treatment cost per admission for ASBO was 4,677.41 Pounds for surgically treated admissions and 1,606.15 Pounds for conservatively treated admissions. The impact of admissions for ASBO is considerable in terms of both costs and workload. Bed stay for these admissions represents the equivalent of almost one surgical bed per year and at least 2 days theatre time, impacting on surgical capacity and waiting lists. Adhesion prevention strategies may reduce the workload associated with ASBO. The review provides useful information for planning resource allocation.},

	abstract = {Background
A novel lyophilized carboxymethylceflulose (CMC) sponge has been developed for prevention of surgical wound adhesions. One potential mechanism for preventing abdominal adhesion is suppression of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and other macrophage derived fibroblast stimulating factors that partially mediate adhesion formation.
Methods
To study the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the CMC sponge, we performed standard cecal denudation and abdominal wall apposition on rats. A CMC sponge or a commercially available adhesion preventive barrier (Interceed) was placed on the denuded surface. After 14 days, adhesion severity was graded blindly on a scale ranging from 0 (no adhesion) to 5 (severe adhesion). TGF-β expression was determined by immunocytochemical staining. To assess the secretion of macrophage derived fibrogenic factors in control and CMC rats, labeled thymidine and proline uptake and hydroxyproline production were measured in NRK rat fibroblasts cultured with conditioned medium of peritoneal macrophages.
Results
The severity of adhesions in the CMC sponge group (0.7 ± 0.3) was significantly lower than in the Interceed or control groups (2.2 ±0.3; 4.6 ± 0.1). In control animals TGF-β expression in endothelium and fibroblasts was maximal on day 3. Neither CMC nor Interceed reduced this expression. Conditioned media derived from sponge-exposed postsurgical peritoneal macrophages did not inhibit fibroblast growth or collagen formation.
Conclusions
In this model the CMC sponge was more effective than Interceed in preventing postoperative adhesions. Its action was not due to inhibition of TGF-β expression or macrophage derived fibrogenic factors. These data highlight the primary importance of local barrier effect in adhesion prevention.},

Symptomatic cases, however, may present with chronic abdominal and pelvic pain, infertility, and intestinal obstruction; and they may require intensive, costly therapeutic modalities. Various agents have been used to prevent PAs, but the results indicate general suboptimal effectiveness. Our objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of two pharmacologic agents for preventing PA: nadroparine calcium (low-molecular-weight heparin, or LMWH) and aprotinin, as well as a barrier agent, sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethycellulose (SCMC). Our subjects were 40 male Wistar-Albino rats divided into four groups, each consisting of 10 rats, which underwent standard cecal abrasion preceding midline laparotomy. In the control group (group 1) 1 ml of 0.9\% NaCl was administered intraperitoneally before abdominal closure. In the three preventive groups, 100 U AXa (anti factor X activity) LMWH, 1800 IU aprotinin, and SCMC were administered intraperitoneally to groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Relaparotomy was performed on the 14th postoperative day. Visceral and abdominal wall adhesions were scored in a blinded fashion. The adhesion scores (mean ± SD) for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 2.00 ± 0.67, 0.6.00 ± 0.84, 1.10 ± 0.74, and 0.20 ± 0.42, respectively. The differences in the adhesion scores among all three preventive groups (groups 2, 3, 4) were statistically significant when compared with the control group (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.017, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively).

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that peritoneal hypofibrinolysis is of importance in the formation of postoperative adhesions, but results from experiments with fibrinolytic modulators are conflicting. We tested this hypothesis in a controlled prospective study in rabbits, comparing the effects of fibrinolytic inhibition (tranexamic acid) to fibrinolysis enhancement by local instillation of gel containing tissue-type plasminogen activator. Adhesion formation was measured after 1 week in a strictly standardized way and is presented as a percentage of an induced lesion that was covered by adhesions. Fibrinolytic inhibition significantly increased adhesion formation, both to the parietal peritoneum (34.2\%± 3.2\%) compared with untreated control (19.7\%± 3.3\%, p {\textless} 0.01) and to the bowel (76.3\%± 5.8\%) compared with untreated control (51.2\%± 8.7\%, p {\textless} 0.05). Control gel significantly increased adhesions to the parietal peritoneum (35.6\%± 4.6\%) versus untreated control (19.7\%± 3.3\%, p {\textless} 0.05), whereas gel containing tissue-type plasminogen activator significantly reduced the amount of adhesions to the parietal peritoneum (4.9\%± 1.7\%) compared with untreated control (19.7\%± 3.3\%, p {\textless} 0.01) and abolished adhesion formation to the injured bowel. The fibrinolytic system thus seems to be intimately involved in the early formation of intraabdominal adhesions.},

	abstract = {Postoperative adhesions occur after almost every abdominal surgery and are the leading cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for more than 40\% of all cases and 60\% to 70\% of those involving the small bowel. This contrasts with earlier experience in the Western World and current practice in the Third World, where abdominal operations are infrequent, hernias remain untreated, and strangulated hernia is common. These are among the findings of prospective and retrospective studies on adhesions conducted at the Westminster Medical School, University of London, London, UK, and of other published studies on the clinical consequences of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions and resultant intestinal obstruction. In an analysis of 210 patients who had undergone at least one previous abdominal operation, 92.9\% had postsurgical adhesions. This is not surprising, given the extreme delicacy of the peritoneum and the fact that apposition of two injured surfaces nearly always results in adhesion formation. Problems resulting from postsurgical adhesions create a considerable workload. At Westminster Hospital over 24 years, intestinal obstruction accounted for 0.9\% of all admissions, 3.3\% of major laparotomies and 28.8\% of cases of large or small bowel obstructions. A 1992 British survey reported an annual total of 12,000 to 14,400 cases of adhesive intestinal obstruction. In 1988 in the United States, admissions for adhesiolysis accounted for nearly 950,000 days of inpatient care. Risk factors, such as type of surgery and site of adhesions, as well as timing and recurrence rate of adhesive obstruction, remain unpredictable or poorly understood. The type of surgery most frequently leading to adhesive obstruction includes colonic, and especially rectal surgery, appendicectomy, and gynecological procedures. Laparoscopy does not seem to eliminate the risk of adhesions and adhesive obstruction. Adhesions involving the small intestine occur less frequently than those involving the omentum, but are more likely to become obstructive. Follow-up of over 2,000 laparotomies at the Westminster Hospital demonstrated that 1\% of patients developed adhesive obstruction within one year of surgery, and half of these occurred within the first postoperative month. However, obstruction may occur at any time, and some 20\% of cases appeared more than 10 years later. Recurrent obstruction following adhesiolysis is common, but actuarial tables still need to be constructed. Adhesive obstruction is clinically challenging, since there is no simple way to differentiate between adhesive and strangulated obstructions. Mortality rates escalate from 3\% for simple obstructions to 30\% when the bowel becomes necrotic or perforated.},

	abstract = {Background: Intestinal obstruction is the most severe consequence of adhesion formation. This study examined the annual surgical workload and costs of intestinal obstruction caused by postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions. Methods: The study was a retrospective case-note review of patients hospitalized for intestinal obstruction caused by postoperative adhesions in a well defined geographical area. The surgical workload and direct costs of inpatient care were analysed. Results: There were 138 admissions for postoperative adhesion-related intestinal obstruction during the study with a total of 1118 inpatient days. The median hospital stay was 4 (range 1–58) days among patients who had non-operative treatment and 11 (range 2–34) days for those who had surgery. Surgery was necessary in 40 patients (29·0 per cent). The mean operating time (time from skin incision to last stitch) and the mean time spent in the operating theatre were 79 and 141 min respectively. The cumulative operating time for the surgical group was 52 h 20 min and the cumulative theatre time was 93 h 44 min. The annual direct hospital cost for postoperative adhesional intestinal obstruction was £181 653 in the district studied and the estimated cost for the whole of Finland was £2 077 796. Conclusion: This population-based study indicates that the workload and costs associated with bowel obstruction caused by postoperative adhesions are substantial.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of crosslinked hyaluronan (HA) hydrogels that contained covalently-bound mitomycin C (MMC) in reducing postoperative adhesions in a rat uterine horn model.
Design
Two independent parameters were investigated: [1] the quantity of MMC in preformed crosslinked hydrogel films and [2] the efficacy of intraperitoneal injection of in situ crosslinkable solutions.
Setting
University animal research facility.
Animal(s)
Female Wistar rats.
Intervention(s)
Injuries (3 × 10 mm) were made to contacting serosal surfaces of the medial uterine wall musculature in female rats. Two treatment protocols were used. In the first, sterile crosslinked HA films that contained different MMC loadings (0, 0.5\%, and 2\%) were applied to two injured uterine horns; control animals received no films. In the second protocol, MMC-loaded crosslinked HA gels that contained different MMC loadings (0.31\%, 0.625\%, and 1.25\%) were spread on the site of uterine horn injury (1 mL); then, an additional 4 mL of the same formulation was injected into the peritoneal cavity after abdominal closure. Control animals were injected with 5 mL of buffer only.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Extent of postoperative adhesions between uterine horns and with surrounding tissues and organs.
Result(s)
Mitomycin C–loaded crosslinked HA films and in situ crosslinked gels were more effective in reducing postoperative adhesion formation than were buffer controls or crosslinked HA films without MMC.
Conclusion(s)
Mitomycin C–loaded crosslinked HA films and gels reduced formation of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions.},

To examine the logistics, safety, and efficacy of N,O-carboxymethylchitosan (NOCC) in reducing adhesions in women.
Design
Multicenter, prospective, randomized, reviewer-blinded clinical trial.
Setting
Gynecologic practices.
Patient(s)
Thirty-four patients were enrolled; 17 in each group were available for the safety analysis and 16 for the efficacy analysis.
Intervention(s)
Adhesion reduction by administration of NOCC vs. Ringer’s lactate at the conclusion of the initial surgical procedure, as assessed at second-look laparoscopy. The NOCC was applied as 200 mL of a 1\% NOCC gel that was tamped in place, followed by 100 mL of 2\% NOCC solution. Efficacy was assessed by covariate analysis.
Main outcome measure(s)
Safety and postoperative adhesion formation.
Result(s)
Groups did not differ in age, ethnicity distribution, height, weight, or body mass index. No deaths or serious adverse events were attributable to NOCC, and no adverse events were definitively or probably related to NOCC administration. Adhesions recurred at 61\% of sites in controls and 38\% of sites in NOCC recipients. De novo grade 1a and 1b adhesions tended to occur more commonly in controls than NOCC recipients. Adhesion extent and severity at second look were also less in NOCC recipients.
Conclusion(s)
Intraperitoneal use of NOCC gel and solution appears to be safe. Despite the small sample, strong trends were identified for reduction of occurrence, extent, and severity of adhesion recurrence and de novo adhesion formation.},

	shorttitle = {Adhesions},
	abstract = {This article summarizes the discussions of the faculty and chairpersons on four major topics on postsurgical adhesions examined at the symposium, "Adhesions: Pathogenesis and Prevention". These topics are: 1) clinical significance; 2) pathogenesis; 3) research status and directions; and 4) recommendations for reduction or prevention. Abdominal postsurgical adhesions develop following trauma to the mesothelium, which is damaged often by surgical handling and instrument contact, foreign materials such as sutures and glove dusting powder, desiccation, and overheating. Postoperative adhesions occur after most surgical procedures and can result in serious complications, including intestinal obstruction, infertility, and pain. A long-term and unpredictable problem, postoperative adhesions impact the surgical workload and hospital resources, resulting in considerable health care expenditures. Although understanding of the pathogenesis of adhesions has improved recently, the molecular mechanisms involved continue to be delineated. Adhesions result from the normal peritoneal wound healing response and develop in the first five to seven days after injury. Adhesion formation and adhesion-free re-epithelialization are alternative pathways, both of which begin with coagulation which initiates a cascade of events resulting in the buildup of fibrin gel matrix. If not removed, the fibrin gel matrix serves as the progenitor to adhesions by forming a band or bridge when two peritoneal surfaces coated with it are apposed. The band or bridge becomes the basis for the organization of an adhesion. Protective fibrinolytic enzyme systems of the peritoneum, such as the plasmin system, can remove the fibrin gel matrix. However, surgery dramatically diminishes fibrinolytic activity. The pivotal events determining whether the pathway taken is adhesion formation or re-epithelialization are therefore the apposition of two damaged surfaces and the extent of fibrinolysis. Research in postsurgical adhesion formation and prevention abounds in a variety of avenues of investigation, including: 1) identification on a molecular level of the components involved in adhesiogenesis and their interactions; 2) clarification of the role of fibrin and fibrinolysis in adhesion formation; 3) standardization of design in preclinical and clinical studies of adhesion formation and prevention; 4) delineation of the relationship between adhesion formation and adhesive complications; and 5) elucidation of efficient, site-specific methods of prophylactic drug delivery. Currently, it seems logical to focus preventive research on development of barriers, fibrinolytic drugs, and selected agents such as phospholipids. The major strategies for adhesion prevention or reduction are adjusting surgical practice and applying adjuvants. Surgeons should adjust their major practices by: 1) becoming aware of the potential adhesive complications of a procedure; 2) minimizing the invasiveness of surgery; and 3) minimizing surgical trauma, ischemia, exposure to intestinal contents, introduction of foreign material into the body, and the use of talc- or starch-containing gloves. Available adjuvants include a newly developed by hyaluronic acid-phosphate-buffered saline solution applied intraoperatively to protect peritoneal surfaces from indirect surgical trauma and three mechanical barriers. One of these, a bioresorbable membrane consisting of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in both general and gynecological surgery. The other two barriers, one made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and one developed from oxidized regenerated cellulose, are indicated only for use in gynecological surgery.},

To assess the effectiveness of bioresorbable Seprafilm membrane in preventing abdominal adhesions in a prospective clinical randomized multicenter trial.

Summary Background Data
Adhesions occur frequently after abdominal operations and are a common cause of bowel obstruction, chronic abdominal pain, and infertility. To reduce the formation of adhesions, a mechanical barrier composed of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose was developed, preventing adherence of tissues after abdominal surgery.

Methods
Between April 1996 and September 1998, all patients requiring a Hartmann procedure for sigmoid diverticulitis or obstructed rectosigmoid were randomized to either intraperitoneal placement of the antiadhesions membrane under the midline during laparotomy and in the pelvis, or as a control. Direct visual evaluation of the incidence and severity of adhesions was performed laparoscopically at second-stage surgery for restoration of the continuity of the colon.

Results
A total of 71 patients were randomized; of these, 42 could be evaluated. The incidence of adhesions did not differ significantly between the two groups, but the severity of adhesions was significantly reduced in the Seprafilm group both for the midline incision and for the pelvic area. Complications occurred in similar numbers in both groups.

Conclusions
Seprafilm antiadhesions membrane appears effective in reducing the severity of postoperative adhesions after major abdominal surgery, although the incidence of adhesions was not diminished. The authors recommend using Seprafilm when relaparotomy or second-look intervention is planned. Long-term studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and value of Seprafilm in preventing bowel obstruction, chronic abdominal pain, and infertility.},

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of atorvastatin with the sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC, Seprafilm; Genzyme; Genzyme Biosurgery Corporation, Cambridge, MA) in preventing postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation in rats.
Methods
Sixty Wistar rats underwent a laparotomy, and adhesions A were induced by cecal abrasion. The animals were divided into 4 groups: group 1, control A; group 2, (A + atorvastatin); group 3, (A + HA/CMC), and group 4, (A + atorvastatin + HA/CMC). The atorvastatin (groups 2 and 4) and HA/CMC (groups 3 and 4) were administered intraperitoneally before the abdominal wall was closed. After 14 days, adhesions were classified by 2 independent surgeons.
Results
The adhesion scores (mean ± standard deviation) for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 2.93 ± .59, 1.85 ± 1.07, 1.80 ± .86, and 1.93 ± .70, respectively. The differences in adhesion scores among all 3 preventive groups (groups 2, 3, and 4) were statistically significant when compared with the control group (P = .005, P = .002, and P = .009, respectively).
Conclusions
These data suggest that atorvastatin, administered intraperitoneally, is as effective as HA/CMC without an expectable additive effect in preventing postoperative adhesions in rats.},

So far, the physical separation of traumatized serosa areas using barriers represents the most important clinical strategy for adhesion prevention. However, the optimal material has not yet been found. Further optimization or pharmacological functionalization of these barriers could give an innovative input for peritoneal adhesion prevention. Therefore, a more complete understanding of pathogenesis is required. On the basis of the pathophysiology of adhesion formation the main barriers currently in clinical practice as well as new innovations are discussed in the present review. Physiologically, mesothelial cells play a decisive role in providing a frictionless gliding surface on the serosa. Adhesion formation results from a cascade of events and is regulated by a variety of cellular and humoral factors. The main clinically applied strategy for adhesion prevention is based on the use of liquid or solid adhesion barriers to separate physically any denuded tissue. Both animal and human trials have not yet been able to identify the optimal barrier to prevent adhesion formation in a sustainable way. Therefore, further developments are required for effective prevention of postoperative adhesion formation. To reach this goal the combination of structural modification and pharmacological functionalization of barrier materials should be addressed. Achieving this aim requires the interaction between basic research, materials science and clinical expertise. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:, 2011.},

	abstract = {Background: In laparoscopic ventral hernia repair a mesh is placed in direct contact with the viscera, often leading to substantial adhesions. In this experimental study the ability of different coated and uncoated meshes to attenuate adhesion formation was examined. Methods: Six commercially available meshes were placed intraperitoneally against a closed peritoneum in rats: Prolene® (polypropylene), Timesh® and Ultrapro® (polypropylene composites with titanium and polyglecaprone respectively), Proceed® and Parietex Composite® (polypropylene and polyester meshes coated with a layer of cellulose and collagen respectively) and C-Qur® (polypropylene mesh coated with a layer of omega-3 fatty acids). Adhesions and incorporation were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically after 7 and 30 days. Results: Parietex Composite® and C-Qur® significantly reduced adhesion formation at 7 days' follow-up compared with all other meshes. By 30 days, this effect had diminished as a significant increase in adhesions together with phagocytosis of the coating was seen for all meshes with layered coatings (Proceed®, Parietex Composite® and C-Qur®). Incorporation was insufficient for all meshes. Conclusion: The absorbable layers of Parietex Composite® and C-Qur® reduce adhesion formation to intraperitoneal mesh in the short term, but the effect diminishes and phagocytosis of absorbable coatings may contribute to adhesion formation.

	issn = {0029-7844},
	abstract = {In this study, we tested the null hypothesis that intraperitoneal adhesion formation and reduction after laser surgery are the same whether the surgery is performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Twenty rabbits were randomly assigned to either laparoscopy or laparotomy and subjected to standardized laser incisions over one uterine horn and over the peritoneal surface of either lower quadrant. Three weeks later, five animals from each group underwent laparoscopy and the other five received laparotomy to score the extent of postoperative adhesions formed and to carry out laser adhesiolysis. The same power density was delivered to tissues in both procedures. Three weeks after the second operative intervention, the animals were killed and the intraperitoneal adhesions blindly scored (scale of 0-3). After the initial procedure, adhesions were absent in the laparoscopy group, but in the laparotomy group, adhesions were frequently present not only at the operative sites of the peritoneal surfaces and uterine horn, but also on the bowel, bladder, and opposite uterine horn where no apparent injury had been inflicted (P less than .005). Three weeks after adhesiolysis, a significant reduction was observed in the mean adhesion scores in the laparoscopy group, but not in the laparotomy group (P = .001). These results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis and confirm the clinical observation that besides reducing operative trauma, discomfort, and cost, laparoscopic laser surgery is very effective in reducing intraperitoneal adhesions and causes significantly less postoperative adhesion formation than does laparotomy.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid solution in preventing intraperitoneal (IP) adhesions.
Design and Setting
The study design was prospective, randomized and blinded and involved 83 rats.
Interventions
Measured serosal injury was inflicted using a CO2 laser on the right uterine horn of the rat. Animals randomized to groups 1 and 2 received either 0.4\% hyaluronic acid or its diluent phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally before and after the injury. In groups 3 and 4, the same solutions were used only after the injury. Postoperative adhesions were assessed at second-look laparotomy. Histologic assessment of the fresh laser injury was carried out on uteri pretreated with hyaluronic acid, PBS, or nothing.
Main Outcome
Pretreatment with hyaluronic acid was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative adhesions and a significantly decreased crater depth.
Conclusions
Hyaluronic acid appears to reduce postoperative IP adhesion formation by coating the serosal surfaces and decreasing the extent of initial tissue injury.},

A great effort has been dedicated to reduce adhesion formation because of the associated morbidity and its complications. Materials and methods. This study was designed as a before-after comparative trial and included 14 rabbits, with a weight between 300 and 500 g. All rabbits were appendectomized and 1 month later laparotomized to assess adhesion formation. Rabbits were randomized into two groups, Group I (control group), with no intervention, and Group II (experimental group), treated with an intraperitoneal sponge of collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone (Clg-PVP). The laparotomy procedure was repeated 1 month later for a new assessment of adhesion formation and histological evaluation by H-E and Masson staining. Results. Histological findings showed abundant infiltrate in the control group, which was mild in the experimental group. With the Masson stain the control group showed a significantly higher amount of collagen than the experimental group and the fibrous tissue was more compact. We found a mean number of adhesions of 3.29 ± 1.98 for the control group, which decreased to 2.57 ± 0.79 after the second laparotomy. For the experimental group the mean number of adhesions decreased from 1.86 ± 0.90 to 0.71 ± 0.49 after the second laparotomy, with no statistical difference between both groups before Clg-PVP application, but a significant statistical difference after the implantation of Clg-PVP (Student’s t test; P {\textless} 0.001, two-tailed).

	abstract = {Postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesions pose a significant medical problem in the Western world, and in the past decade progress has been made in understanding their pathophysiology. The early balance between fibrin formation and degradation in the peritoneal cavity during and after surgery seems to be a major determinant of adhesion formation. Postsurgical inhibition of fibrinolytic activity severely impairs fibrin breakdown. Adhesive small-bowel obstruction, inadvertent enterotomy at reoperation, prolonged operative time dividing adhesions, increased clinical workload and high financial costs are important adhesion-related problems discussed in this review. The cumulative risk of adhesive small-bowel obstruction after (sub)total colectomy is 11\% within 1 year, increasing to 30\% at 10 years. One of five patients undergoing reoperation suffers from inadvertent enterotomy, resulting in significant postoperative morbidity and mortality. Roughly 3\% of all surgical admissions are associated with intra-abdominal adhesions. Clinical prospective trials have recently been designed to investigate the efficacy of barrier membranes and gels in the reduction of abdominal and pelvic adhesions and prevention of long-term morbidity, e.g., adhesive bowel obstruction and infertility in women. Early results are promising and contribute to the increased interest among clinicians in postsurgical adhesion formation and its consequences.},

The objective of the study was the laparoscopic evaluation of the incidence of intraabdominal adhesions related to prior abdominal surgery.
Study Design
This was a prospective monocentric study including a continuous series of 1000 gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. Data were collected on history of abdominal surgery. A precise initial description of intraoperative adhesions was performed.
Results
Six hundred thirty-seven of the 1000 procedures (63.7\%) were performed in patients with a history of 1 or more than 1 abdominal surgery. Intraoperative adhesions were found in 211 of the 1000 subjects (21.10\%). Fifty-nine of the 211 cases (28\%) involved bowel loops. The prior indication for surgery did not seem to influence adhesion formation. The rate of intestinal adhesions significantly increased with the number of prior abdominal surgeries. The rate of intestinal adhesions was significantly higher in cases of prior midline incisions in comparison with the other incisions.
Conclusion
Extensive preoperative knowledge of prior surgery is essential to evaluate the risk of adhesion formation.},

In addition, a cost analysis was performed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 102 patients who underwent surgery between 1987 and 1992 for intestinal obstruction due to abdominal adhesions. Results: Median follow-up was 14 years. The 102 patients experienced 273 episodes of intestinal obstruction after the index operation, of which 237 involved inpatient readmissions; 47·3 per cent of the episodes resulted in further surgery. Single band adhesions were more common in patients with no previous abdominal surgery (P {\textless} 0·001). Some 52·0 per cent of the patients had undergone only one operation for SBO. A mean of 2·7 episodes per patient occurred after the index operation. The cost of adhesion-related problems in this study was €1 588 594 or €6702 per inpatient episode. Conclusion: The readmission rate in a selected cohort of patients with proven intra-abdominal adhesions was higher than reported previously. The annual cost of adhesion-related problems in Sweden was estimated as €39·9–59·5 million, and the cost of inpatient readmissions was almost equal to that for gastric cancer.

In tissue specimens from controls, the adhesions were marked by mature collagen bundles. In treated rats, the adhesions were immature, characterized by early inflammatory cells, less collagen formation, and no collagen bundles. Conclusion.

To compare the efficacy of crosslinked Carbylan-SX (Carbylan BioSurgery, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) hydrogel films and sprayable gels as physical barriers in reducing postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions in the rat cecum-abdominal wall and rat uterine horn models.
Design
Pre-formed crosslinked Carbylan-SX films and sprayable in situ crosslinkable Carbylan-SX gels were evaluated in rat cecum-abdominal wall and rat uterine horn models and compared with commercially available and clinically used Seprafilm.
Setting
University animal research facility.
Animals
Female Wistar rats.
Intervention(s)
Abrasions were made with the foot-pedal–operated Flex-shaft (Dremel, Racine, WI) on both the cecum and abdominal wall (each area 10 mm in diameter) in female rats as one model and on both uterine horns (3 × 10 mm) in female rats as the other model. In each of the two adhesion models, four groups were assigned with eight rats in each group: (1) untreated control, (2) treated with Seprafilm (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA), (3) treated with preformed Carbylan-SX hydrogel films, and (4) treated with sprayable Carbylan-SX gel.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Extent and severity of postoperative adhesions between the cecum and the abdominal wall in rat cecum-abdominal wall model and between the uterine horns in rat uterine horn model.
Result(s)
The Carbylan-SX film and the Carbylan-SX sprayable gel led to fewer adhesions than Seprafilm in both rat adhesion models. Interestingly, a single physical form was not optimal for both models: the Carbylan film was more efficacious in the rat uterine horn model, whereas Carbylan gel gave the best results in the rat cecum-abdominal wall model.
Conclusion(s)
Both Carbylan-SX film and gel were efficacious in reducing postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion formation in rat cecum-abdominal wall and uterine horn models.},

	abstract = {Background: Adhesion formation represents a major complication after lower abdominal operations. It is postulated that a shift in surgical practice in recent years toward the use of less invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of intraperitoneal adhesions and in the rate of adhesiolysis procedures. Using an attributable-risk methodology, this cost-of-illness study was designed to estimate the hospitalization rate and expenditures for adhesiolysis in the United States in 1994 and to examine changes in attributable expenditures since 1988. Study Design: A national hospital discharge data base was used to identify all abdominal adhesion procedures performed in the United States in 1994. Total hospitalization expenditures were based on Medicare payment rates for adhesiolysis hospitalizations and physician services, which were applied to the total number of inpatient days attributed to adhesiolysis. The results were compared with published rates and expenditures attributed to adhesiolysis in 1988. Results: Adhesiolysis was responsible for 303,836 hospitalizations during 1994, primarily for procedures on the digestive and female reproductive systems. These procedures accounted for 846,415 days of inpatient care and \$1.3 billion in hospitalization and surgeon expenditures. Conclusions: Although the adhesiolysis hospitalization rate has remained constant since 1988, inpatient expenditures have decreased by nearly 10\% because of a 15\% decrease in the average length of stay. The increased use of laparoscopy during this 6-year period does not appear to be associated with a concomitant reduction in the adhesiolysis hospitalization rate, suggesting that the causes of adhesion formation warrant further research.},

This article compares the incidence of adhesions with other conditions in order to identify the level of risk. The health economics surrounding adhesion-related disease are described. This combined information may be of help to convince health practitioners of the need to take a more active role in adhesion prevention. The SCAR project has identified the risk of adhesion-related disease. This is compared with published risks of other common clinical situations. An economic model first described by the author in 2002 has been revised with 2006 costs [1]. The SCAR data demonstrates a directly related risk of re-admission in certain groups of 9.4\% over 5 years [2]. The frequency of including this fact in the consenting process is low ({\textless}15\%) [3]. Legal precedent has identified a risk of {\textgreater}2\% warrants inclusion in the consent process; failure to do so could be considered negligent [4]. Use of an anti-adhesion product with a cost of 130 euros with an efficacy of 25\% in 1 year in the UK could save over 40 million euros over a 10-year period. Adhesion risk is frequent enough to include in consent. Failure to do this and avoidance of treatment, which may reduce adhesions will have major financial consequences on healthcare systems.},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the disease burden of the most important complications of postoperative abdominal adhesions: small bowel obstruction, difficulties at reoperation, infertility, and chronic pain.
Design Systematic review and meta-analyses.
Data sources Searches of PubMed, Embase, and Central, from January 1990 to December 2012, without restrictions to publication status or language.
Study selection All types of studies reporting on the incidence of adhesion related complications were considered.
Data extraction and analysis The primary outcome was the incidence of adhesive small bowel obstruction in patients with a history of abdominal surgery. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of small bowel obstruction by any cause, difference in operative time, enterotomy during adhesiolysis, and pregnancy rate after abdominal surgery. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were done to study the robustness of the results. A random effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.
Results We identified 196 eligible papers. Heterogeneity was considerable for almost all meta-analyses. The origin of heterogeneity could not be explained by study design, study quality, publication date, anatomical site of operation, or operative technique. The incidence of small bowel obstruction by any cause after abdominal surgery was 9\% (95\% confidence interval 7\% to 10\%; I2=99\%). the incidence of adhesive small bowel obstruction was 2\% (2\% to 3\%; I2=93\%); presence of adhesions was generally confirmed by emergent reoperation. In patients with a known cause of small bowel obstruction, adhesions were the single most common cause (56\%, 49\% to 64\%; I2=96\%). Operative time was prolonged by 15 minutes (95\% confidence interval 9.3 to 21.1 minutes; I2=85\%) in patients with previous surgery. Use of adhesiolysis resulted in a 6\% (4\% to 8\%; I2=89\%) incidence of iatrogenic bowel injury. The pregnancy rate after colorectal surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was 50\% (37\% to 63\%; I2=94\%), which was significantly lower than the pregnancy rate in medically treated patients (82\%, 70\% to 94\%; I2=97\%).
Conclusions This review provides detailed and systematically analysed knowledge of the disease burden of adhesions. Complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent, have a large negative effect on patients’ health, and increase workload in clinical practice. The quantitative effects should be interpreted with caution owing to large heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Objectives
Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.
Methods
In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.
Results
Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.
Conclusions
We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite preventive efforts, influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year in the United States (US). Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively.
Objective
We estimate age- and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States.
Methods
Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in \$2003.
Results
Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1million hospitalized days, and 31.4million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs averaged \$10.4billion (95\% confidence interval [C.I.], \$4.1, \$22.2) annually. Projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to \$16.3billion (C.I., \$8.7, \$31.0) annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to \$87.1billion (C.I., \$47.2, \$149.5).
Conclusions
These results highlight the enormous annual burden of influenza in the US. While hospitalization costs are important contributors, lost productivity from missed work days and lost lives comprise the bulk of the economic burden of influenza.},

Certain groups are at greatest risk, such as the young, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic underlying medical conditions: the high-risk groups. Traditionally, annual vaccination has been targeted to people classified as being at high risk, particularly the elderly, but in recent years, there has been a broadening of vaccination recommendations to target larger numbers of people. This has recently culminated in the recommendation of “universal vaccination” in the USA (everyone over 6 months of age is recommended to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine). In this review, we will look at coverage rates in Europe and the USA, changes in vaccination guidelines, and the rationale for broadening vaccination recommendations. It is clear that often only modest improvements in vaccination coverage have occurred recently, with programs targeting risk groups, but some substantial increases in coverage have followed the broadening of USA vaccination recommendations to all persons under 18 years and to middle-aged healthy adults (≥50 years). It is likely, however, that some of these increases may be because of the increased awareness related to the recent pandemic. It is unclear if increases in coverage will translate into public health benefits, but perhaps results will be similar to experiments with universal vaccination in Ontario, Canada, where increased coverage may have provided some reductions in healthcare use, fewer influenza-associated deaths, and even financial benefits.},

	abstract = {The instability of protein during preparation, storage, and release has become a major concern in recent years in the encapsulation of proteins into biodegradable polymers for controlled release systems. The present investigation was performed to study the mechanism of degradation of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) in double emulsion and solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) encapsulation processes. The stabilizing effects of various excipients during the period of protein atomization using spray freeze-drying and subsequent encapsulation into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microspheres were explored. The size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) results showed that ultrasonication did not change the primary structure of IgG signiﬁcantly. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that the subsequent double-emulsion solvent evaporation process denatured nearly 80\% of the total amount of IgG. This was possibly due to the adsorption, unfolding, and aggregation of IgG at the water/organic solvent interface. Both mannitol and trehalose could stabilize IgG during spray freeze-drying, with over 90\% retention of its molecular integrity and immunoactivity, which were veriﬁed using SEC-HPLC and ELISA. Solid protein microparticles were further entrapped into monolithic-type microspheres of PLGA using the S/O/W method. FTIR results suggested that the incomplete release that is often observed in the formulation of controlled protein release systems may be due to the degradation or aggregation of protein in the solid polymer matrix.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide a comprehensive review of recent epidemiologic data on the burden of adhesion-related complications and adhesion prevention. Second, we elaborate on economic considerations for the application of antiadhesion barriers.
Background: Because the landmark SCAR studies elucidated the impact of adhesions on readmissions for long-term complications of abdominal surgery, adhesions are widely recognized as one of the most common causes for complications after abdominal surgery. Concurrently, interest in adhesion prevention revived and several new antiadhesion barriers were developed. Although these barriers have now been around for more than a decade, adhesion prevention is still seldom applied.
Methods: The first part of this article is a narrative review evaluating the results of recent epidemiological studies on adhesion-related complications and adhesion prevention. In part II, these epidemiological data are translated into a cost model of adhesion-related complications and the potential costeffectiveness of antiadhesion barriers is explored.
Results: New epidemiologic data warrant a shift in our understanding of the socioeconomic burden of adhesion-related complications and the indications for adhesion prevention strategies. Increasing evidence from cohort studies and systematic reviews shows that difficulties during reoperations, rather than small bowel obstructions, account for the majority of adhesion-related morbidity. Laparoscopy and antiadhesion barriers have proven to reduce adhesion formation and related morbidity. The direct health care costs associated with treatment of adhesion-related complications within the first 5 years after surgery are \$2350 following open surgery and \$970 after laparoscopy. Costs are about 50\% higher in fertile-age female patients. Application of an antiadhesion barriers could save between \$328 and \$680 after open surgery. After laparoscopy, the costs impact ranges from \$82 in expenses to \$63 of savings.
Conclusions: Adhesions are an important cause for long-term complications in both open and laparoscopic surgery. Adhesiolysis during reoperations seems to impact adhesion-related morbidity most. Routine application of antiadhesion barriers in open surgery is safe and cost-effective. Application of antiadhesion barriers can be cost-effective in selected cases of laparoscopy. More research is needed to develop barriers suitable for laparoscopic use.},

	abstract = {Background
Adhesions after abdominal and pelvic surgery are important complications, although their basic epidemiology is unclear. We investigated the frequency of such complications in the general population to provide a basis for the targeting and assessment of new adhesion-prevention measures.
Methods
We used validated data from the Scottish National Health Service medical record linkage database to identify patients undergoing open abdominal or pelvic surgery in 1986, who had no record of such surgery in the preceding 5 years. Patients were followed up for 10 years and subsequent readmissions were reviewed and outcomes classified by the degree of adhesion. We also assessed the rate of adhesion-related admissions in 1994 for the population of 5 million people.
Findings
1209 (5·7\%) of all readmissions (21 347) were classified as being directly related to adhesions, with 1169 (3·8\%) managed operatively. Overall, 34·6\% of the 29 790 patients who underwent open abdominal or pelvic surgery in 1986 were readmitted a mean of 2·1 times over 10 years for a disorder directly or possibly related to adhesions, or for abdominal or pelvic surgery that could be potentially complicated by adhesions. 22·1\% of all outcome readmissions occurred in the first year after initial surgery, but readmissions continued steadily thoughout the 10-year period. In 1994, 4199 admissions were directly related to adhesions.
Interpretation
Postoperative adhesions have important consequences to patients, surgeons, and the health system. Surgical procedures with a high risk of adhesion-related complications need to be identified and adhesion prevention carefully assessed.},

	abstract = {In spite of the approaches that have been proposed to reduce postoperative peritoneal adhesions, they remain a major clinical problem because of the associated intestinal obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, female infertility and difficulties at the time of reoperation. The pathogenesis of the process have been focused almost exclusively on the local events induced by the surgical trauma, and the strategies for adhesion prevention thus focused on barriers to separate surgically denuded areas. The important role of the peritoneal cavity environment only recently became apparent and is not yet incorporated in adhesion reducing strategies. Recent data demonstrate that, in the presence of a direct surgical trauma, the entire peritoneal environment is quantitatively the most important factor in adhesion formation and hence adhesion prevention after both open and laparoscopic surgery. Indeed mesothelial hypoxia (CO2 pneumoperitoneum) or hyperoxia (open surgery), desiccation and surgical manipulation have been identified as factors cumulatively enhancing adhesions. The clinical implication is especially relevant for laparoscopic surgery because the pneumoperitoneum, being a closed environment, can be easily conditioned. Although human studies are lacking, animal data indicate that peritoneal adhesions can be reduced by over 80\% with a good surgical technique, with adequate pneumoperitoneum conditioning as adding 3-4\% of oxygen to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum, prevention of desiccation and slight cooling. Adhesion prevention barriers remain additionally effective, although quantitatively less important. The relevance of all these strategies for adhesion prevention still have to be confirmed in humans, but since it seems that the peritoneal environment is quantitatively much more important than the surgical trauma, adhesion prevention research and strategies should be directed more to conditioning the peritoneal cavity than to the use of agents.},

	abstract = {Objective
To compare the interobserver reproducibility of two adhesion scoring methods, a more comprehensive adhesion scoring method and the American Fertility Society (AFS) adhesion scoring method.
Design
Eleven endoscopic surgeons independently evaluated and scored 13 surgical video recordings using both systems.
Material and Methods
The standardized AFS adhesion scoring method and the more comprehensive adhesion scoring method were utilized to assess abdominal adhesions. The more comprehensive adhesion scoring method scored 23 individual locations in the abdominal cavity for severity (0, none; 1, filmy, avascular; 2, vascular and/or dense; 3, cohesive) and extent of total area or length (0, none; 1, ≤25\%; 2, 26\% to 50\%; 3, {\textgreater}50\%). Because the best method of representing a composite adhesion score is unclear, the more comprehensive adhesion scoring method employed two independent methods of determining total score based on the severity and extent at each location, either adding severity plus extent or multiplying severity times extent before summing all 23 locations.
Results
For each scoring method, a correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the 55 pairs of surgeons. Significant correlations were identified for all methods (AFS adhesion scoring method: 35 of 55, 64\%; more comprehensive adhesion scoring method: severity plus extent, 49 of 55, 89\%; and more comprehensive adhesion scoring method: severity times extent, 53 of 55, 96\%). When the more comprehensive adhesion scoring method is limited to 13 areas in the lower pelvis corresponding to the locations represented in the AFS adhesion scoring method, the proportion of significant correlation coefficients become 54 of 55 and 50 of 55 for severity plus extent and severity times extent, respectively.
Conclusion
Although the AFS adhesion scoring method generated significant agreement between pairs of surgeons, less than a third correlated at the 0.7 level. Use of the more comprehensive adhesion scoring method specifically demonstrating locations, severity, and extent of adhesions produced a marked increase in reproducibility between surgeon pairs in scoring pelvic adhesions.},

	abstract = {A vaccination regimen capable of eliciting potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) remains an unachieved goal of the HIV-1 vaccine field. Here, we report the immunogenicity of longitudinal prime/boost vaccination regimens with a panel of HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp140 protein immunogens over a period of 200 weeks in guinea pigs. We assessed vaccine regimens that included a monovalent clade C gp140 (C97ZA012 [C97]), a tetravalent regimen consisting of four clade C gp140s (C97ZA012, 459C, 405C, and 939C [4C]), and a tetravalent regimen consisting of clade A, B, C, and mosaic gp140s (92UG037, PVO.4, C97ZA012, and Mosaic 3.1, respectively [ABCM]). We found that the 4C and ABCM prime/boost regimens were capable of eliciting greater magnitude and breadth of binding antibody responses targeting variable loop 2 (V2) over time than the monovalent C97-only regimen. The longitudinal boosting regimen conducted over more than 2 years increased the magnitude of certain tier 1 NAb responses but did not increase the magnitude or breadth of heterologous tier 2 NAb responses. These data suggest that additional immunogen design strategies are needed to induce broad, high-titer tier 2 NAb responses.
IMPORTANCE The elicitation of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) remains an elusive goal for the HIV-1 vaccine field. In this study, we explored the use of a long-term vaccination regimen with different immunogens to determine if we could elicit bNAbs in guinea pigs. We found that longitudinal boosting over more than 2 years increased tier 1 NAb responses but did not increase the magnitude and breadth of tier 2 NAb responses. These data suggest that additional immunogen designs and vaccination strategies will be necessary to induce broad tier 2 NAb responses.},

	abstract = {Vaccine-elicited immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been shown to be important for protection against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in rhesus monkeys. However, it remains unclear whether vaccine-elicited IgA responses are beneficial or detrimental for protection. In this study, we evaluated the kinetics, magnitude, breadth, and linear epitope specificities of vaccine-elicited IgG and IgA responses in serum and mucosal secretions following intramuscular immunization with adenovirus 26 (Ad26) prime, Env protein boost vaccination regimens. The systemic and mucosal antibody responses exhibited kinetics similar to those of the serum antibody responses but lower titers than the serum antibody responses. Moreover, the IgG and IgA responses were correlated, both in terms of the magnitude of the responses and in terms of the antibody specificities against linear human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env, Gag, and Pol epitopes. These data suggest that IgG and IgA responses are highly coordinated in both peripheral blood and mucosal compartments following Ad26/Env vaccination in rhesus monkeys.
IMPORTANCE Vaccine-elicited IgG responses are important for protection against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in nonhuman primates. However, much less is known about the role and function of IgA, despite it being the predominant antibody in mucosal sites. There is debate as to whether HIV-1-specific IgA responses are beneficial or detrimental, since serum anti-Env IgA titers were shown to be inversely correlated with protection in the RV144 clinical trial. We thus assessed vaccine-elicited IgG and IgA antibody responses in peripheral blood and mucosal secretions following vaccination with the Ad26/Env vaccine.},

Neutralization titers measured by this assay are highly correlated to those measured by an assay using replication-competent SARS-CoV. No cross-neutralization occurred with human sera known to contain antibodies to coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E. The pseudotype assay was used to profile neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV S in sequential serum samples taken from 41 confirmed SARS patients during the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong and shows long-lasting immunity in most recovered patients.

	abstract = {PLGA microspheres containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model antigen, were prepared by a double emulsion/solvent extraction method and their in vitro characterization was performed. The same microspheres were used in a series of in vivo studies to evaluate the immune response induced after subcutaneous or oral inoculation following different immunization protocols. The in vivo data confirm that the immunogenicity of the albumin is not affected by the encapsulation procedure. The subcutaneous administration of microspheres showed an immune response (serum IgG levels by ELISA) statistically above BSA solution, even when the dose administered was 10 times lower. The adjuvanticity of the microspheres was found to be comparable to that of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), but in contrast to FCA they are biocompatible and did not induce any adverse reaction at the site of injection. A single oral administration of the microspheres was not a successful strategy for the induction of a reproducible response. Therefore, microspheres of 1 and 5 μm were orally administered on 3 consecutive days and the response obtained showed that the use of a boosting dose was not necessary for the 1 μm particles. These results suggest the possibility of simplifying the immunization schedule to a primary immunization if 1 μm particles are administered.},

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98\% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88\% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79\%) and MERS-CoV (about 50\%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses -- the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -- exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95\% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95\% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95\% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods  This was a retrospective review of 172 patients admitted at the Philippine General Hospital from 2010 to 2018 with the diagnosis of POA. Patients who did not undergo surgery and patients who had a different cause of bowel obstruction with the adhesions being only incidental were excluded from the study.
Results  Ninety-one patients were included in the study. The mean age at surgery was 92.32 months and the male:female ratio was 2.8:1.

	abstract = {Progressive peritoneal fibrosis affects patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has no reliable treatment. The mechanisms that initiate and sustain peritoneal fibrosis remain incompletely elucidated. To overcome these problems, we developed a strategy that prevents peritoneal fibrosis by suppressing PD-stimulated mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT). We evaluated single-cell transcriptomes of mesothelial cells obtained from normal peritoneal biopsy and effluent from PD-treated patients. In cells undergoing MMT, we found cellular heterogeneity and intermediate transition states associated with up-regulation of enzymes involved in glycolysis. The expression of glycolytic enzymes was correlated with the development of MMT. Using gene expression profiling and metabolomics analyses, we confirmed that PD fluid induces metabolic reprogramming, characterized as hyperglycolysis, in mouse peritoneum. We found that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) can substitute for PD fluid to stimulate hyperglycolysis, suppressing mitochondrial respiration in mesothelial cells. Blockade of hyperglycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) inhibited TGF-β1–induced profibrotic cellular phenotype and peritoneal fibrosis in mice. We developed a triad of adeno-associated viruses that overexpressed microRNA-26a and microRNA-200a while inhibiting microRNA-21a to target hyperglycolysis and fibrotic signaling. Intraperitoneal injection of the viral triad inhibited the development of peritoneal fibrosis induced by PD fluid in mice. We conclude that hyperglycolysis is responsible for MMT and peritoneal fibrogenesis, and this aberrant metabolic state can be corrected by modulating microRNAs in the peritoneum. These results could provide a therapeutic strategy to combat peritoneal fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of Sepraﬁlm in preventing abdominal adhesions after radical resection of rectal carcinoma, and to observe whether Sepraﬁlm had any adverse effects in patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Methods. A total of 62 patients participated in this prospective randomized clinical study, which was conducted to compare the outcomes of patients operated on with Sepraﬁlm (SEPRA+) with those operated on without Sepraﬁlm (SEPRA-). All patients received preoperative radiotherapy, followed by a two-stage operation, and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)-based systemic chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of severity and extent of adhesions were evaluated at the time of ileostomy closure. The secondary endpoint included the recurrence of tumors, late complications, and outcome.
Results. Sepraﬁlm signiﬁcantly reduced the adhesions in both the midline incision area and peristomal area. This in turn reduced the operation time, blood loss, and extent of the incision at ileostomy closure. Sepraﬁlm was not associated with any postoperative complications or chemoradiation-related toxicity, nor did it affect recurrence or survival rates.
Conclusion. Sepraﬁlm effectively reduced abdominal adhesions in chemoradiated patients, and had no adverse effects on the oncologic results of fully introduced adjuvant therapy. Thus, Sepraﬁlm is a safe and effective tool for use in rectal carcinoma surgery.},

We report our experience with treatment of this challenging patient population using laparoscopic lysis of adhesions (LOA) and placement of Sepraﬁlm (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Methods: The participants in this study were 19 consecutive patients (2 men and 17 women) who underwent laparoscopic LOA and placement of Sepraﬁlm between July 1998 and July 2001. Patients with abdominal pain resulting from irritable bowel syndrome, hernias, or endometriosis were excluded. The patients had undergone a mean of 6.4 previous abdominal procedures (range, 1–14) and 2.3 previous LOAs (range, 0–10). They had experienced chronic, intractable abdominal pain for at least 4 months (range, 4–180). Eight patients had preoperative obstructive symptoms.
Results: A completely laparoscopic procedure was used to treat 16 patients, whereas the procedure for 3 patients was converted to open surgery because of dense adhesions. Perioperative complications included two patients in whom enterocutaneous ﬁstulae developed and one patient with intraabdominal hematoma. At follow-up (mean, 9.6 months; range, 1–32 months), 14 patients (73.7\%) had completely discontinued all pain medications. At this writing, 12 of these patients are completely symptom free. Two patients are taking nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed, and three patients require round-the-clock narcotics. Three patients were readmitted with small bowel obstruction, which was managed nonoperatively. One patient had diagnostic laparoscopy for recurrent pain 6 months postoperatively, but had no adhesions.
Conclusion: Chronic intractable abdominal pain is relieved in most patients via this approach. Repeat laparoscopy in two patients showed no intraabdominal adhesions. Laparoscopic LOA and placement of Sepraﬁlm is an excellent approach to this challenging pa-},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adhesion formation after peritoneal surgery is a major cause of postoperative bowel obstruction, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In this study, we compared the possible individual effects of phosphatidylcholine (PC), Seprafilm® II, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and the combined effects of phosphatidylcholine and t-PA on postoperative adhesion formation in a rat surgical model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 Wistar male rats underwent median laparotomy and standardized abrasion of the visceral and parietal peritoneum. phosphatidylcholine, Seprafilm II, and t-PA alone and phosphatidylcholine and t-PA in combination were applied intraperitoneally at the end of the surgical procedure. Seven days after surgery, a relaparotomy was performed for adhesion grading and histopathological examination.
RESULTS: A comparison of adhesion stages demonstrated a significant difference between the control group and the study groups (p{\textless}0.001). The adhesion grade of the combined treatment group was statistically different from that of the other groups (p{\textless}0.05). In the t-PA group and the combined group, six and two rats, respectively, developed hematomas locally on the cecum.
CONCLUSIONS: PC, t-PA, and Seprafilm II used individually reduced the adhesion grade. The t-PA and phosphatidylcholine combination was most effective in reducing adhesion formation. On the other hand, usage of t-PA alone or in combination may increase risk of bleeding. More detailed studies are needed, and future studies on the efficacy of a material for decreasing adhesion formation should include a comparison of several control materials in the same model.},

	abstract = {Formation of intra-abdominal adhesions is a common consequence of abdomino-pelvic surgery, radiation therapy, and inflammatory processes. In a small but clinically significant proportion of patients, adhesive disease may develop, wherein adhesions lead to a variety of chronic symptoms such as abdominal distension, pain, nausea, and abnormal bowel movement pattern which can be daily, intermittent, or episodic. Due to the chronic and troublesome nature of these symptoms, adhesive disease may be life-altering in many patients, particularly when not recognized and appropriately addressed, as is the case not infrequently. In addition, there is a paucity of literature regarding the evaluation and management of patients with suspected abdominal adhesive disease. Therefore, in this concise review, we provide a clinically practical synopsis of the etiopathogenesis, symptoms, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of abdominal adhesive disease.,

However, when normal repair mechanisms breakdown, mesothelial cells take on a profibrotic role, secreting inflammatory, and profibrotic mediators, differentiating and migrating into the injured tissues where they contribute to fibrogenesis. The development of new molecular and cell tracking techniques has made it possible to examine the origin of fibrotic cells within damaged tissues and to elucidate the roles they play in inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to secreting proinflammatory mediators and contributing to both coagulation and fibrinolysis, mesothelial cells undergo mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process analogous to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and become fibrogenic cells. Fibrogenic mesothelial cells have now been identified in tissues where they have not previously been thought to occur, such as within the parenchyma of the fibrotic lung. These findings show a direct role for mesothelial cells in fibrogenesis and open therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse the fibrotic process.},

In the last hundred years, four influenza A virus pandemics have had a devastating effect, especially the 1918 influenza pandemic that took the lives of at least 40 million people. There is a constant risk that currently circulating avian influenza A viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9) will cause a new pandemic. Vaccines are the cornerstone in preparing for and combating potential pandemics. Despite exceptional advances in the design and development of (pre-)pandemic vaccines, there are still serious challenges to overcome, mainly caused by intrinsic characteristics of influenza A viruses: Rapid evolution and a broad host range combined with maintenance in animal reservoirs, making it near impossible to predict the nature and source of the next pandemic virus. Here, recent advances in the development of vaccination strategies to prepare against a pandemic virus coming from the avian reservoir will be discussed. Furthermore, remaining challenges will be addressed, setting the agenda for future research in the development of new vaccination strategies against potentially pandemic influenza A viruses.},

With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development. Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non‐existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited. While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non‐replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility.},

	abstract = {On the record
Vaccines prevent disease and save lives; however, lack of standardized immunization recordkeeping makes it challenging to track vaccine coverage across the world. McHugh et al. developed dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin. Particle patterns are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones. By codelivering a vaccine, the pattern of particles in the skin could serve as an on-person vaccination record. Patterns were detected 9 months after intradermal delivery of microparticles in rats, and codelivery of inactivated poliovirus led to protective antibody production. Discrete microneedle-delivered microparticle patterns in porcine and pigmented human skin were identifiable using semiautomated machine learning. These results demonstrate proof of concept for intradermal on-person vaccination recordkeeping.
Accurate medical recordkeeping is a major challenge in many low-resource settings where well-maintained centralized databases do not exist, contributing to 1.5 million vaccine-preventable deaths annually. Here, we present an approach to encode medical history on a patient using the spatial distribution of biocompatible, near-infrared quantum dots (NIR QDs) in the dermis. QDs are invisible to the naked eye yet detectable when exposed to NIR light. QDs with a copper indium selenide core and aluminum-doped zinc sulfide shell were tuned to emit in the NIR spectrum by controlling stoichiometry and shelling time. The formulation showing the greatest resistance to photobleaching after simulated sunlight exposure (5-year equivalence) through pigmented human skin was encapsulated in microparticles for use in vivo. In parallel, microneedle geometry was optimized in silico and validated ex vivo using porcine and synthetic human skin. QD-containing microparticles were then embedded in dissolvable microneedles and administered to rats with or without a vaccine. Longitudinal in vivo imaging using a smartphone adapted to detect NIR light demonstrated that microneedle-delivered QD patterns remained bright and could be accurately identified using a machine learning algorithm 9 months after application. In addition, codelivery with inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced neutralizing antibody titers above the threshold considered protective. These findings suggest that intradermal QDs can be used to reliably encode information and can be delivered with a vaccine, which may be particularly valuable in the developing world and open up new avenues for decentralized data storage and biosensing.
Near-infrared fluorescent microparticles administered to the skin via dissolvable microneedle patches can record vaccine delivery.

Despite its relatively mild impact on healthy adults, ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been associated with severe birth defects. Currently, there is no ZIKV vaccine available, but several vaccine candidates based on the ZIKV membrane (M) and envelope (Env) structural proteins showed promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Here, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a non-replicating adenoviral vector type 26 (Ad26) that encodes the ZIKV M-Env antigens (Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env) was evaluated in mice and non-human primates (NHP). Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env induced strong and durable cellular and humoral immune responses in preclinical models. Humoral responses were characterized by Env-binding and ZIKV neutralizing antibody responses while cellular responses were characterized by ZIKV reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Importantly, a single immunization with a very low dose of 4x107 vp of Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env protected mice from ZIKV challenge. In NHP, a single immunization with a typical human dose of 1x1011 vp of Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env also induced Env-binding and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies and Env and M specific cellular immune responses that associated with complete protection against viremia from ZIKV challenge as measured in plasma and other body fluids. Together these data provide the rationale to progress the Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env candidate vaccine to clinical testing.},

	abstract = {Background
The expansion of Zika virus (ZIKV) into the Western Hemisphere and recognition of congenital Zika syndrome have created a need for a safe, effective and rapidly-scalable ZIKV vaccine. We developed a purified formalin-inactivated ZIKV vaccine (ZPIV) candidate that was advanced to human testing after demonstrating protective efficacy in mice and non-human primates against viremia after ZIKV challenge.

Methods
We carried out three phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of ZPIV co-formulated with aluminum hydroxide gel. Healthy adults were randomly assigned (4:1 or 5:1) to receive 5 μg of ZPIV or saline placebo, intramuscularly, at days 1 and 29. Investigators and participants were masked to group assignment (vaccine or placebo). The primary objective of all three trials was to assess the interim safety and immunogenicity of the ZPIV candidate. We measured the frequency of adverse events and ZIKV envelope microneutralization (MN) titers through day 57 to meet this objective. We also assessed the protective efficacy of purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from vaccinees against Zika viremia in mice. The three trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers: NCT02963909, NCT02952833, NCT02937233).

Findings
Sixty-eight participants were enrolled across the three trials between November 7, 2016 and January 25, 2017. Due to enrollment error, one participant was excluded and sixty-seven participants (55 vaccine, 12 placebo) received the full series of two injections. The vaccine caused only mild or moderate reactogenicity. By day 57, 92\% (N=51) of vaccine recipients seroconverted (MN titer {\textgreater} 1:10). Microneutralization geometric mean titers peaked at day 43 and exceeded protective thresholds observed in prior animal models. Adoptive transfer of day 57 purified IgG provided robust protection against viremia in ZIKV-challenged mice.

Interpretation
ZPIV was well-tolerated and elicited robust neutralizing antibody titers in healthy adults. ZPIV-elicited human antibodies protected against viral challenge in mice, potentially providing a quantifiable and prospectively testable correlate of immunity for this vaccine candidate.

While composition of adjuvants is integral in defining the overall performance of an adjuvant, some physical parameters such as particle size, surface charge and surface modification may also contribute to the potency. In this review, we will try to highlight the role of particle size in controlling the immune responses to adjuvanted vaccines, with a focus on insoluble aluminum salts, oil-in-water emulsions, polymeric particles and liposomes.},

Anti-tumor immunotherapy has the potential to significantly improve the prognosis of cancer treatment, though the efficacy of immunotherapy generally needs further improvement. One way to improve the efficacy is using immune adjuvants, but the adjuvants for anticancer immunotherapy have to be more potent than for prophylactic vaccines. Here, we report that compared to conventional alum adjuvant, aluminum oxide nanoparticles (nano-alum) may further enhance the anticancer effects of an immunotherapy that employs tumor cell vaccine (TCV). The average tumor size tends to be lower in animals that receive the combinational treatment of nano-alum and TCV. The anticancer cytotoxicity by the lymphocytes was also significantly higher in the treatment group that received both TCV and nano-alum. These results suggest that nano-alum may potentially serve as a potent immune adjuvant and have prospective applications in anticancer immunotherapy.},

We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.},

This in vivo study investigated the comparative effectiveness of paclitaxel, sirolimus, and sunitinib using a perivascular biodegradable microneedle cuff. A total of 31 New Zealand white rabbits were used. Rhodamine was used to visualize drug distribution (n = 3). Sirolimus- (n = 7), sunitinib- (n = 7), and paclitaxel-loaded (n = 7) microneedle cuffs were placed at balloon-injured abdominal aortae and compared to drug-free cuffs (n = 7). Basic histological structures were not affected by microneedle devices, and vascular wall thickness of the device-only group was similar to that of normal artery. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly decreased neointima formation in all drug-treated groups (p \&lt; 0.001). However, the tunica media layer of the paclitaxel-treated group was significantly thinner than that of other groups and also showed the highest apoptotic ratio (p \&lt; 0.001). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were significantly reduced in all drug-treated groups. Sirolimus or sunitinib appeared to be more appropriate for microneedle devices capable of slow drug release because vascular wall thickness was minimally affected.},

Thus far, efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines have focused on the viral envelope. ZIKV NS1 as a vaccine immunogen has not been fully explored, although it can circumvent the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV infection, associated with envelope antibodies. Here, we describe a novel DNA vaccine encoding a secreted ZIKV NS1, that confers rapid protection from systemic ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice. We identify novel NS1 T cell epitopes in vivo and show that functional NS1-specific T cell responses are critical for protection against ZIKV infection. We demonstrate that vaccine-induced anti-NS1 antibodies fail to confer protection in the absence of a functional T cell response. This highlights the importance of using NS1 as a target for T cell–based ZIKV vaccines.

Thus, vaccination against SARS-CoV may represent an effective approach towards controlling SARS. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is thought to play a role in induction of cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV and thus it is important to characterize this protein. In the present study, an E1/partially E3-deleted, replication-defective human adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector (Ad5-N-V) expressing the SARS-CoV N protein was constructed. The N protein, expressed {\textless}span class="jp-italic"{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/span{\textgreater} by Ad5-N-V, was of the expected molecular mass of 50 kDa and was phosphorylated. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with Ad5-N-V generated potent SARS-CoV-specific humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses. These results show that Ad5-N-V may potentially be used as a SARS-CoV vaccine.,},

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 1·5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 2·5 more than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 3·5 more than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ was 1·5. For \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This requires not only designing devices that are small and lightweight, but also autonomous and independent of electricity. Here, we present a strategy for conducting automated multistep diagnostic assays using chemically generated, passively regulated heat. Ligation and polymerization reagents for rolling circle amplification of nucleic acids are separated by meltable phase-change partitions, thus replacing precise manual reagent additions with automated partition melting. To actuate these barriers and individually initiate the various steps of the reaction, field ration heaters exothermically generate heat in a thermos, whereas fatty acids embedded in a carbonaceous matrix passively buffer the temperature around their melting points. Achieving multistage temperature profiles extend the capability of instrument-free diagnostic devices and improve the portability of reaction automation systems built around phase-change partitions.},

Those that transition from viscous flow to elastic, solidlike behavior at approximately 1 Hz demonstrate pressure-sensitivity yet also have sufficient elasticity for durable bonding to soft, wet tissue. The pressure-sensitive tissue adhesive (PSTA) blends produce increasingly stronger pull-apart adhesion in response to compressive pressure application, from 10 to 300 s. By incorporating a stiffer high molecular weight component, the PSTA exhibits dramatically improved burst pressure (greater than 100 kPa) when used as a tissue sealant. The PSTA’s biodegradation mechanism can be switched from erosion (occurring primarily over the first 10 days) to bulk chemical degradation (and minimal erosion) depending on the chemistry of the high molecular weight component. Interestingly, fibrosis toward the PSTA is reduced when fast-occurring erosion is the dominant biodegradation mechanism.},

	abstract = {A tunable protease responsive nanoparticle hydrogel (PRNH) that demonstrates large non-iridescent color changes due to a degradation-directed assembly of nanoparticles is reported. Structurally colored composites are fabricated with silica particles, 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol) norbornene (4PEGN), and a proteolytically degradable peptide. When placed in a protease solution, the peptide crosslinks degrade causing electrostatic binding and adsorption of the polymer to the particle surface which leads to the assembly of particles into compact amorphous arrays with structural color. The particle surface charge and size is investigated to probe their effect on the assembly mechanism. Interestingly, only PRNHs with highly negative particle surface charge exhibit color changes after degradation. Ultra-small angle X-ray scattering revealed that the particles become coated in polymer after degradation, producing a material with less order compared to the initial state. Altering the particle diameter modulates the composites’ color, and all sizes investigated (178–297 nm) undergo the degradation-directed assembly. Varying the amount of 4PEGN adjusts the swollen PRNH color and has no effect on the degradation-directed assembly. Taken together, the effects of surface charge, particle size, and polymer concentration allow for the formulation of new design rules for fabricating tunable PRNHs that display vivid changes in structural color upon degradation.},

While SARS-CoV infection has not recurred to a significant extent since 2003, it still remains a potential threat. Understanding of SARS and development of therapeutic approaches have been hampered by the absence of an animal model that mimics the human disease and is reproducible. Here we show that transgenic mice that express the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) in airway and other epithelia develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with a human strain of the virus. Infection begins in airway epithelia, with subsequent alveolar involvement and extrapulmonary virus spread to the brain. Infection results in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both the lung and the brain. This model of lethal infection with SARS-CoV should be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for the development of antiviral therapies.},

Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory disease and a {\textasciitilde}2\% case fatality rate started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Following unprecedented rapid global spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although data on disease in humans are emerging at a steady pace, certain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can only be studied in detail in animal models, where repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques, with disease lasting 8-16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Taken together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of medical countermeasures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about an unprecedented crisis, taking a heavy toll on human health, lives as well as the global economy. There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3 μg or 6 μg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9\% and 16.2\% for the intra- and inter-assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.},

	abstract = {The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell–cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.},

The GD03 strain, which was isolated from an index patient of the second outbreak, was reported to resist neutralization by the human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) 80R and S3.1, which can potently neutralize isolates from the first outbreak. Here we report that two hmAbs, m396 and S230.15, potently neutralized GD03 and representative isolates from the first SARS outbreak (Urbani, Tor2) and from palm civets (SZ3, SZ16). These antibodies also protected mice challenged with the Urbani or recombinant viruses bearing the GD03 and SZ16 spike (S) glycoproteins. Both antibodies competed with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD), suggesting a mechanism of neutralization that involves interference with the SARS-CoV–ACE2 interaction. Two putative hot-spot residues in the RBD (Ile-489 and Tyr-491) were identified within the SARS-CoV spike that likely contribute to most of the m396-binding energy. Residues Ile-489 and Tyr-491 are highly conserved within the SARS-CoV spike, indicating a possible mechanism of the m396 cross-reactivity. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis data show that m396 might neutralize all zoonotic and epidemic SARS-CoV isolates with known sequences, except strains derived from bats. These antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity against isolates from the two SARS outbreaks and palm civets and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.},

The spike (S) glycoprotein, the major target for vaccine and immune therapy, shows up to 17 substitutions in its 1,255-aa sequence; however, the biologic significance of these changes is unknown. Here, the functional effects of S mutations have been determined by analyzing their affinity for a viral receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), and their sensitivity to Ab neutralization with viral pseudotypes. Although minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003 were found, substantial functional changes were detected in S derived from a case in late 2003 from Guangdong province [S(GD03T0013)] and from two palm civets, S(SZ3) and S(SZ16). S(GD03T0013) depended less on the hACE-2 receptor and was markedly resistant to Ab inhibition. Unexpectedly, Abs that neutralized most human S glycoproteins enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S glycoproteins. The mechanism of enhancement involved the interaction of Abs with conformational epitopes in the hACE-2-binding domain. Finally, improved immunogens and mAbs that minimize this complication have been defined. These data show that the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses can be enhanced by Abs, and they underscore the need to address the evolving diversity of this newly emerged virus for vaccines and immune therapies.},

Recently, a small fragment on the SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318–510) was characterized as a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on susceptible cells. In this study, we demonstrated that a fusion protein containing RBD linked to human IgG1 Fc fragment (designated RBD-Fc) induced high titer of RBD-specific Abs in the immunized mice. The mouse antisera effectively neutralized infection by both SARS-CoV and SARS pseudovirus with mean 50\% neutralization titers of 1/15,360 and 1/24,737, respectively. The neutralization determinants on the RBD of S protein were characterized by a panel of 27 mAbs isolated from the immunized mice. Six groups of conformation-dependent epitopes, designated as Conf I–VI, and two adjacent linear epitopes were identified by ELISA and binding competition assays. The Conf IV and Conf V mAbs significantly blocked RBD-Fc binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, suggesting that their epitopes overlap with the receptor-binding sites in the S protein. Most of the mAbs (23 of 25) that recognized the conformational epitopes possessed potent neutralizing activities against SARS pseudovirus with 50\% neutralizing dose ranging from 0.005 to 6.569 μg/ml. Therefore, the RBD of SARS S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes capable of inducing potent neutralizing Ab responses, and is an important target site for developing vaccines and immunotherapeutics.},

To develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus, we constructed Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins. Afterward, we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test (pNT) and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility. We tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sIPV vaccines by pNT and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests (cNT). A strong correlation was observed between two methods, with the correlation coefficients of all three types of IPV vaccines being greater than 0.82 (p {\textless} 0.0001). The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) values obtained by pNT were approximately four times higher than that by cNT, revealing the better sensitivity of pNT. In conclusion, pNT is a safe, rapid and sensitive quantitative assay with the potential of being an alternative for the evaluation of the potency of polio vaccines.},

In recent years, reestablishment of PV circulation in countries where PV was previously eliminated has occurred because of decreased herd immunity, possibly due to poor vaccination coverage. To monitor the vulnerability of countries to PV circulation, surveillance of neutralizing-antibody titers against PV in susceptible populations is essential in the end game of the polio eradication program. In this study, we have developed a PV neutralization test with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses to determine the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV in human serum samples. With this test, the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV could be determined within 2 days by automated interpretation of luciferase signals without using infectious PV strains. We validated the pseudovirus PV neutralization test with 131 human serum samples collected from a wide range of age groups (ages 1 to {\textgreater}60 years) by comparison with a conventional neutralization test. We found good correlation in the neutralizing-antibody titers determined by these tests. These results suggest that a pseudovirus PV neutralization test would serve as a safe and simple procedure for the measurement of the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV.},

When used as vaccine adjuvants, CpG ODNs improve the function of professional antigen-presenting cells and boost the generation of humoral and cellular vaccine-specific immune responses. These effects are optimized by maintaining ODNs and vaccine in close proximity. The adjuvant properties of CpG ODNs are observed when administered either systemically or mucosally, and persist in immunocompromised hosts. Preclinical studies indicate that CpG ODNs improve the activity of vaccines targeting infectious diseases and cancer. Clinical trials demonstrate that CpG ODNs have a good safety profile and increase the immunogenicity of coadministered vaccines.},

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 μg/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15812.1},
	abstract = {Background:
              There is currently a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The intensity and duration of this first wave in the UK may be dependent on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmits more effectively in the winter than the summer and the UK Government response is partially built upon the assumption that those infected will develop immunity to reinfection in the short term. In this paper we examine evidence for seasonality and immunity to laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) from a prospective cohort study in England.
            
            
              Methods:
              In this analysis of the Flu Watch cohort, we examine seasonal trends for PCR-confirmed coronavirus infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) in all participants during winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) and during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (May-Sep 2009). We also included data from the pandemic and ‘post-pandemic’ winter seasons (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) to identify individuals with two confirmed HCoV infections and examine evidence for immunity against homologous reinfection.
            
            
              Results:
              We tested 1,104 swabs taken during respiratory illness and detected HCoV in 199 during the first four seasons. The rate of confirmed HCoV infection across all seasons was 390 (95\% CI 338-448) per 100,000 person-weeks; highest in the Nov-Mar 2008/9 season at 674 (95\%CI 537-835). The highest rate was in February at 759 (95\% CI 580-975). Data collected during May-Sep 2009 showed there was small amounts of ongoing transmission, with four cases detected during this period. Eight participants had two confirmed infections, of which none had the same strain twice.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Our results provide evidence that HCoV infection in England is most intense in winter, but that there is a small amount of ongoing transmission during summer periods. We found some evidence of immunity against homologous reinfection.},

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general adult population as well as samples from COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that these assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as two days post COVID19 symptoms onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Such serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers may, in the future, also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we investigated both seroconversion and PCR-positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in New York City. Methods: Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies.

	abstract = {Background
Injection using needle and syringe (N\&S) is the most widely used method for vaccination, but requires trained healthcare workers. Fear of needles, risk of needle-stick injury, and the need to reconstitute lyophilised vaccines, are also drawbacks. The Nanopatch (NP) is a microarray skin patch comprised of a high-density array of microprojections dry-coated with vaccine that is being developed to address these shortcomings. Here we report a randomised, partly-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that represents the first use in humans of the NP to deliver a vaccine.
Methods
Healthy volunteers were vaccinated once with one of the following: (1) NPs coated with split inactivated influenza virus (A/California/07/2009 [H1N1], 15 µg haemagglutinin (HA) per dose), applied to the volar forearm (NP-HA/FA), n = 15; (2) NPs coated with split inactivated influenza virus (A/California/07/2009 [H1N1], 15 µg HA per dose), applied to the upper arm (NP-HA/UA), n = 15; (3) Fluvax® 2016 containing 15 µg of the same H1N1 HA antigen injected intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid (IM-HA/D), n = 15; (4) NPs coated with excipients only, applied to the volar forearm (NP-placebo/FA), n = 5; (5) NPs coated with excipients only applied to the upper arm (NP-placebo/UA), n = 5; or (6) Saline injected IM into the deltoid (IM-placebo/D), n = 5. Antibody responses at days 0, 7, and 21 were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralisation (MN) assays.
Findings
NP vaccination was safe and acceptable; all adverse events were mild or moderate. Most subjects (55\%) receiving patch vaccinations (HA or placebo) preferred the NP compared with their past experience of IM injection with N\&S (preferred by 24\%). The antigen-vaccinated groups had statistically higher HAI titres at day 7 and 21 compared with baseline (p {\textless} 0.0001), with no statistical differences between the treatment groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05), although the group sizes were small. The geometric mean HAI titres at day 21 for the NP-HA/FA, NP-HA/UA and IM-HA/D groups were: 335 (189–593 95\% CI), 160 (74–345 95\% CI), and 221 (129–380 95\% CI) respectively. A similar pattern of responses was seen with the MN assays. Application site reactions were mild or moderate, and more marked with the influenza vaccine NPs than with the placebo or IM injection.
Interpretation
Influenza vaccination using the NP appeared to be safe, and acceptable in this first time in humans study, and induced similar immune responses to vaccination by IM injection.},

More and more human studies have been done with MNs to bridge the gap between research and market applications that provide efficacious techniques for clinical implementation.Areas covered: The aim of this review is provide a brief description of the status of human study with MNs and to demonstrate progress for the right use of microneedle arrays in clinical settings. It also describes the considerations for clinical application with each type of MNs.Expert opinion: Microneedle systems were introduced to overcome the limitations of conventional methods of drug administration. Lots of microneedle systems have undergone clinical evaluation to determine their efficacy and safety, and many studies have demonstrated positive results. The successful clinical use of the microneedle in vaccine therapy is remarkable and supports the importance of conducting further tests in a wide range of medical applications.

However, this method is not ideal due to limitations, such as the risk of needle-stick injury, the requirement for trained personnel to give injections and the need to reconstitute lyophilized vaccines. Therefore, we tested an alternative delivery technology that overcomes the problems with needle and syringe. The Nanopatch™ is an array of 10,000 silicon micro-projections per cm2 that can be dry-coated with vaccine for skin delivery. The high number and density of micro-projections means that high velocity application is required to achieve consistent skin penetration. Before clinically testing a vaccine Nanopatch, this study tests the safety, tolerability and acceptability/utility of uncoated and excipient-coated Nanopatches in healthy adults. Nanopatches were applied to skin of the upper arm and volar forearm and left in contact with the skin for two minutes before removal. The application sites were assessed for local skin response over 28 days. Acceptability interviews were also performed. No unexpected adverse events directly related to the Nanopatch application were reported. All applications of the Nanopatch resulted in an expected erythema response which faded between days 3 and 7. In some subjects, some skin discolouration was visible for several days or up to 3 weeks after application. The majority (83\%) of subjects reported a preference for the Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe and found the application process to be simple and acceptable. On a pain scale from 0 to 10, 78\% of applications were scored “0” (no pain) with the average scores for less than 1. The results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of the Nanopatch to improve vaccination by showing that application of the product without vaccine to human skin is safe, tolerable and preferred to needle and syringe administration.

	abstract = {Background
Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection.
Methods
We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines.
Findings
Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization.
Interpretation
MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Background The Vaxxas high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) consists of a high density of microprojections coated with vaccine for delivery into the skin. Microarray patches (MAPs) offer the possibility of improved vaccine thermostability as well as the potential to be safer, more acceptable, easier to use, and more cost-effective for the administration of vaccines than injection by needle and syringe (N\&S). Here, we report a phase I trial using the Vaxxas HD-MAP to deliver a monovalent influenza vaccine that was to the best of our knowledge the first clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lower doses of influenza vaccine delivered by MAPs. Methods and findings HD-MAPs were coated with a monovalent, split inactivated influenza virus vaccine containing A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 H1N1 haemagglutinin (HA). Between February 2018 and March 2018, 60 healthy adults (age 18–35 years) in Melbourne, Australia were enrolled into part A of the study and vaccinated with either: HD-MAPs delivering 15 μg of A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 H1N1 HA antigen (A-Sing) to the volar forearm (FA); uncoated HD-MAPs; intramuscular (IM) injection of commercially available quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) containing A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 H1N1 HA (15 μg/dose); or IM injection of H1N1 HA antigen (15 μg/dose). After 22 days’ follow-up and assessment of the safety data, a further 150 healthy adults were enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 9 treatment groups. Participants (20 per group) were vaccinated with HD-MAPs delivering doses of 15, 10, 5, 2.5, or 0 μg of HA to the FA or 15 μg HA to the upper arm (UA), or IM injection of QIV. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine delivered by HD-MAP. Primary and secondary objectives were assessed for up to 60 days post-vaccination. Clinical staff and participants were blind as to which HD-MAP treatment was administered and to administration of IM-QIV-15 or IM-A/Sing-15. All laboratory investigators were blind to treatment and participant allocation. Two further groups in part B (5 participants per group), not included in the main safety and immunological analysis, received HD-MAPs delivering 15 μg HA or uncoated HD-MAPs applied to the forearm. Biopsies were taken on days 1 and 4 for analysis of the cellular composition from the HD-MAP application sites. The vaccine coated onto HD-MAPs was antigenically stable when stored at 40°C for at least 12 months. HD-MAP vaccination was safe and well tolerated; any systemic or local adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate. Observed systemic AEs were mostly headache or myalgia, and local AEs were application-site reactions, usually erythema. HD-MAP administration of 2.5 μg HA induced haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralisation (MN) titres that were not significantly different to those induced by 15 μg HA injected IM (IM-QIV-15). HD-MAP delivery resulted in enhanced humoral responses compared with IM injection with higher HAI geometric mean titres (GMTs) at day 8 in the MAP-UA-15 (GMT 242.5, 95\% CI 133.2–441.5), MAP-FA-15 (GMT 218.6, 95\% CI 111.9–427.0), and MAP-FA-10 (GMT 437.1, 95\% CI 254.3–751.3) groups compared with IM-QIV-15 (GMT 82.8, 95\% CI 42.4–161.8), p = 0.02, p = 0.04, p {\textless} 0.001 for MAP-UA-15, MAP-FA-15, and MAP-FA-10, respectively. Higher titres were also observed at day 22 in the MAP-FA-10 (GMT 485.0, 95\% CI 301.5–780.2, p = 0.001) and MAP-UA-15 (367.6, 95\% CI 197.9–682.7, p = 0.02) groups compared with the IM-QIV-15 group (GMT 139.3, 95\% CI 79.3–244.5). Results from a panel of exploratory immunoassays (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, CD4+ T-cell cytokine production, memory B cell (MBC) activation, and recognition of non-vaccine strains) indicated that, overall, Vaxxas HD-MAP delivery induced immune responses that were similar to, or higher than, those induced by IM injection of QIV. The small group sizes and use of a monovalent influenza vaccine were limitations of the study. Conclusions Influenza vaccine coated onto the HD-MAP was stable stored at temperatures up to 40°C. Vaccination using the HD-MAP was safe and well tolerated and resulted in immune responses that were similar to or significantly enhanced compared with IM injection. Using the HD-MAP, a 2.5 μg dose (1/6 of the standard dose) induced HAI and MN titres similar to those induced by 15 μg HA injected IM.

Several obstacles to achieving high coverage with measles and rubella vaccines exist, some of which could be overcome with new vaccine delivery technologies. Microarray array patches (MAPs) are single-dose devices used for transcutaneous administration of molecules, including inactivated or attenuated vaccines, that penetrate the outer stratum corneum of the skin, delivering antigens to the epidermis or dermis. MAPs to deliver measles and rubella vaccines have the potential to be a transformative technology to achieve elimination goals in the African Region. MAPs for measles and rubella vaccination have been shown to be safe, immunogenic and thermostable in preclinical studies but results of clinical studies in humans have not yet been published.

	abstract = {Augmentation of immunogenicity can be achieved by particulate delivery of an antigen and by its co-administration with an adjuvant. However, many adjuvants initiate strong systemic inflammatory reactions in vivo, leading to potential adverse events and safety concerns. We have developed a synthetic vaccine particle (SVP) technology that enables co-encapsulation of antigen with potent adjuvants. We demonstrate that co-delivery of an antigen with a TLR7/8 or TLR9 agonist in synthetic polymer nanoparticles results in a strong augmentation of humoral and cellular immune responses with minimal systemic production of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, antigen encapsulated into nanoparticles and admixed with free TLR7/8 agonist leads to lower immunogenicity and rapid induction of high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum (e.g., TNF-a and IL-6 levels are 50- to 200-fold higher upon injection of free resiquimod (R848) than of nanoparticle-encapsulated R848). Conversely, local immune stimulation as evidenced by cellular infiltration of draining lymph nodes and by intranodal cytokine production was more pronounced and persisted longer when SVP-encapsulated TLR agonists were used. The strong local immune activation achieved using a modular self-assembling nanoparticle platform markedly enhanced immunogenicity and was equally effective whether antigen and adjuvant were co-encapsulated in a single nanoparticle formulation or co-delivered in two separate nanoparticles. Moreover, particle encapsulation enabled the utilization of CpG oligonucleotides with the natural phosphodiester backbone, which are otherwise rapidly hydrolyzed by nucleases in vivo. The use of SVP may enable clinical use of potent TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants for indications where cellular immunity or robust humoral responses are required.},

	abstract = {Antigen-specific immune tolerance has been a long-standing goal for immunotherapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies and for the prevention of allograft rejection and anti-drug antibodies directed against biologic therapies. Nanoparticles have emerged as powerful tools to initiate and modulate immune responses due to their inherent capacity to target antigen presenting cells (APCs) and deliver coordinated signals that can elicit an antigen-specific immune response. A wide range of strategies have been described to create tolerogenic NPs (tNPs) that fall into three broad categories. One strategy includes tNPs that provide antigen alone to harness natural tolerogenic processes and environments, such as presentation of antigen in the absence of co-stimulatory signals, oral tolerance, the tolerogenic environment of the liver, and apoptotic cell death. A second strategy includes tNPs that carry antigen and simultaneously target tolerogenic receptors, such as pro-tolerogenic cytokine receptors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), FAS receptor, and the CD22 inhibitory receptor. A third strategy includes tNPs that carry a payload of tolerogenic pharmacological agents that can “lock” APCs into a developmental or metabolic state that favors tolerogenic presentation of antigens. These diverse strategies have led to the development of tNPs that are capable of inducing antigen-specific immunological tolerance, not just immunosuppression, in animal models. These novel tolerogenic nanoparticle technologies heralds a promising approach to specifically prevent and treat unwanted immune reactions in humans. The first tNP, SEL-212, a biodegradable synthetic vaccine particle encapsulating rapamycin (SVP-Rapamycin), has reached the clinic and is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials.},

	abstract = {A major obstacle to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid-α-glucosidase (rhGAA) for Pompe disease is the development of high titers of anti-rhGAA antibodies in a subset of patients, which often leads to a loss of treatment efﬁcacy. In an effort to induce sustained immune tolerance to rhGAA, we supplemented the rhGAA therapy with a weekly intravenous injection of synthetic vaccine particles carrying rapamycin (SVP-Rapa) during the ﬁrst 3 weeks of a 12-week course of ERT in GAA-KO mice, and compared this with three intraperitoneal injections of methotrexate (MTX) per week for the ﬁrst 3 weeks. Empty nanoparticles (NP) were used as negative control for SVP-Rapa. Co-administration of SVP-Rapa with rhGAA resulted in more durable inhibition of anti-rhGAA antibody responses, higher efﬁcacy in glycogen clearance in skeletal muscles, and greater improvement of motor function than mice treated with empty NP or MTX. Body weight loss was observed during the MTX-treatment but not SVP-Rapa-treatment. Our data suggest that co-administration of SVP-Rapa may be an innovative and safe strategy to induce durable immune tolerance to rhGAA during the ERT in patients with Pompe disease, leading to improved clinical outcomes.},

However, due to the diﬃculty of implanting biomaterials or tissue engineering constructs into a partial-thickness cartilage defect, it remains a challenge to provide a satisfactory cure in joint surface regeneration in the early and middle stages of osteoarthritis. In this study, we focused on a ready-to-use tissue-adhesive joint surface paint (JS-Paint) capable of promoting and enhancing articular surface cartilage regeneration. The JS-Paint is mainly composed of N-(2aminoethyl)-4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrosophenoxy) butanamide (NB)-coated silk ﬁbroin microparticles and possess optimal cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation properties. NB-modiﬁed silk ﬁbroin microparticles can directly adhere to the cartilage and form a smooth layer on the surface via the photogenerated aldehyde group of NB reacting with the −NH2 groups of the cartilage tissue. JS-Paint treatment showed a signiﬁcant promotion of cartilage regeneration and restored the smooth joint surface at 6 weeks postsurgery in a rabbit model of a partial-thickness cartilage defect. These ﬁndings revealed that silk ﬁbroin can be utilized to bring about a tissue-adhesive paint. Thus, the JS-Paint strategy has some great potential to enhance joint surface regeneration and revolutionize future therapeutics of early and middle stages of osteoarthritis joint ailments.},

The use of these new adhesives is based exclusively on their temperature-dependent rheological properties. Since biocompatibility and biodegradability are additional crucial attributes of tissue adhesives, the polymers were tailored so that they as well as their degradation products are non-toxic. Branched oligomers consisting of a core molecule and biodegradable chains bound to it were synthesized and the relationship between their composition and their adhesive properties under in vitro conditions, was investigated. The oligomers comprised trimethylolpropane as the trifunctional central molecule, while lactoyl and caprolactone units formed the biodegradable segments. Oligomers with glass transition temperatures in the 20–25 C range, were found to perform better. A strong connection was found between the length of the PLA blocks, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the different materials and their Adhesive Failure Strength (AFS) at 37 C. The remarkable ﬂexibilizing effect of the caprolactone units incorporated along the PLA blocks, allowed to generate longer biodegradable chains and to improve, therefore, the adhesive strength of the oligomers, while keeping their Tg within the appropriate temperature interval. The TMP(LA16–CL2–LA16–CL2–LA16)3 oligomer attained especially high AFS values under in vitro conditions.},

With polydopamine hydrogel as the microneedle base and a loop of suction-cup-structured concave chambers encircling each microneedle, the generated microneedles can fit the skin well; keep strong adhesion in dry, moist, and wet environments; and realize self-repair after being split into two parts. Besides, as polymyxin is loaded into both the hydrogel tips and the polydopamine base, the microneedles are endowed with excellent ability to resist common bacteria during storage and usage. We have demonstrated that these microneedles not only showed excellent adhesion when applied to knuckles and ideal antibacterial activity but also performed well in drug-sustained release and treatment for the osteoarthritis rat model. These results indicate that bioinspired multifunctional microneedles will break through the limitation of traditional methods and be ideal candidates for versatile transdermal drug delivery systems.},

Here, we designed biocompatible hydrogels comprising polysaccharides with polyacrylamide and exhibiting promising cytocompatibility, antibacterial activity, and excellent tissue adhesion. Alginate/chitosan-based hydrogels covalently cross-linked to the tissue surface in order to achieve admirable tissue adhesion. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the hydrogels were significantly enhanced with the addition of polyacrylamide, which synergistically promoted their enhanced adhesion. Importantly, the hydrogels exhibited good biocompatibility and reasonable antibacterial activity that promoted wound recovery during use as wound dressings.

To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.},

	abstract = {Tissue adhesives play a vital role in surgical processes as a substitute for sutures in wound closure. However, several existing tissue adhesives suffer from cell toxicity, weak tissue-adhesive strength, and high cost. In this study, by taking advantage of the fast and speciﬁc inverse-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction, a series of bioadhesives were produced by employing copper-free click chemistry pair transcyclooctene (TCO) /tetrazine (Tz) in chitosan. The gelation time of the bioadhesives can be optimized to be less than 2 minutes, which meets the need for surgical wound closure in practice. By adding 4-arm polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde (PEG-PALD) as a co-crosslinker, the adhesive strength of the bioadhesives was optimized to be 2.3 times higher than that of the conventional ﬁbrin glue. Moreover, by adjusting the amount of the co-crosslinker, the swelling ratio and pore size of the chitosan bioadhesives can be tuned to ﬁt the need of drug encapsulation and cell seeding. The chitosan bioadhesives possess no signiﬁcant in vitro cytotoxicity. Using a mice skin incision wound model, we found that the chitosan bioadhesives were able to close the wound faster and promote wound healing process than the ﬁbrin glue. In conclusion, our results support that the innovative click-chemistry based bioadhesives have been developed with improved physical and biological properties for surgical wound closures.},

	abstract = {We developed a tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG) for use in children and present results of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved clinical trial evaluating this graft in patients with single-ventricle cardiac anomalies. The TEVG was used as a Fontan conduit to connect the inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery, but a high incidence of graft narrowing manifested within the first 6 months, which was treated successfully with angioplasty. To elucidate mechanisms underlying this early stenosis, we used a data-informed, computational model to perform in silico parametric studies of TEVG development. The simulations predicted early stenosis as observed in our clinical trial but suggested further that such narrowing could reverse spontaneously through an inflammation-driven, mechano-mediated mechanism. We tested this unexpected, model-generated hypothesis by implanting TEVGs in an ovine inferior vena cava interposition graft model, which confirmed the prediction that TEVG stenosis resolved spontaneously and was typically well tolerated. These findings have important implications for our translational research because they suggest that angioplasty may be safely avoided in patients with asymptomatic early stenosis, although there will remain a need for appropriate medical monitoring. The simulations further predicted that the degree of reversible narrowing can be mitigated by altering the scaffold design to attenuate early inflammation and increase mechano-sensing by the synthetic cells, thus suggesting a new paradigm for optimizing next-generation TEVGs. We submit that there is considerable translational advantage to combined computational-experimental studies when designing cutting-edge technologies and their clinical management.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Although oral drug delivery is preferred by patients, it is not possible for proteins because the gastrointestinal tract is not sufficiently permeable. To enable the non-toxic oral uptake of protein drugs, we investigated plant-based foods as intestinal permeation enhancers, hypothesizing that compounds found in food would be well-tolerated by the gastrointestinal tract. Following a screen of over 100 fruits, vegetables, herbs, and fungi, we identified strawberry as a potent enhancer of macromolecular permeability in vitro and in mice. Natural product chemistry techniques identified pelargonidin, an anthocyanidin, as the active compound. In mice, insulin was orally administered with pelargonidin to induce sustained pharmacodynamic effects with doses as low as 1 U/kg and bioactivity of over 100\% relative to the current gold standard of subcutaneous injection. Pelargonidin-induced permeability was reversible within two hours of treatment, and one month of daily dosing did not adversely affect mice as determined by weight tracking, serum concentrations of inflammatory markers, and tight junction gene expression. Results underscore the utility of plant-based foods in biomedical applications and demonstrate pelargonidin as an especially potent enhancer for the oral delivery of biologics.},

	abstract = {Background Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County.
Methods On 4/3-4/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARSCoV-2 in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity. We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test manufacturer’s data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both.
Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5\% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97\%), and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81\% (95CI 2.24-3.37\%). Under the three scenarios for test performance characteristics, the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49\% (95CI 1.80-3.17\%) to 4.16\% (2.58-5.70\%). These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 5085-fold more than the number of confirmed cases.
Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.},

	abstract = {Existing tissue adhesives have a trade-oﬀ between adhesive strength and biocompatibility. Here, we report a series of biocompatible multiarmed polycaprolactones (PCL) as tissue adhesives that can be released from a hot glue gun and the length of each arm was kept at ∼2−3 kg mol−1 in all the polymers. The adhesion properties were dependent on the number of functionalized (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS), aldehyde (CHO), and isocyanate (NCO)) arms of the multiarmed polymers. The more arms, the higher the adhesion strength. For example, the adhesion strength in binding cut rat skin increased from 2.3 N cm−2 for 2PCLNHS to 11.2 N cm−2 for 8-PCL-NHS. CHO- and NCO-modiﬁed 8PCL also had suitable adhesive properties. All the multiarmed polymers had minimal cytotoxicity in vitro and good biocompatibility in vivo, suggesting their potential as promising alternative surgical adhesives.},

	abstract = {Phosphoserine-modiﬁed cements (PMCs) are a family of wet-ﬁeld tissue adhesives that bond strongly to bone and biomaterials. The present study evaluated variations in the adhesive strength using a scatter plot, failure mode, and a regression analysis of eleven factors. All single-factor, continuous-variable correlations were poor (R2 {\textless} 0.25). The linear regression model explained 31.6\% of variation in adhesive strength (R2 = 0.316 p {\textless} 0.001), with bond thickness predicting an 8.5\% reduction in strength per 100 µm increase. Interestingly, PMC adhesive strength was insensitive to surface roughness (Sa 1.27–2.17 µm) and the unevenness (skew) of the adhesive bond (p {\textgreater} 0.167, 0.171, ANOVA). Bone glued in conditions mimicking the operating theatre (e.g., the rapid ﬁxation and minimal ﬁxation force in ﬂuids) produced comparable adhesive strength in laboratory conditions (2.44 vs. 1.96 MPa, p {\textgreater} 0.986). The failure mode correlated strongly with the adhesive strength; low strength PMCs ({\textless}1 MPa) failed cohesively, while high strength ({\textgreater}2 MPa) PMCs failed adhesively. Failure occurred at the interface between the amorphous surface layer and the PMC bulk. PMC bonding is suﬃcient for clinical application, allowing for a wide tolerance in performance conditions while maintaining a minimal bond strength of 1.5–2 MPa to cortical bone and metal surfaces.},

However, existing tissue adhesives still have several limitations. Tremendous eﬀorts have been invested into developing new tissue adhesives by improving upon existing adhesives through diﬀerent strategies. Therefore, highlighting and analyzing these design strategies are essential for developing the next generation of advanced adhesives. To this end, we reviewed the available strategies for modifying traditional adhesives (including cyanoacrylate glues, ﬁbrin sealants and BioGlue), as well as design of emerging adhesives (including gelatin sealants, methacrylated sealants and bioinspired adhesives), focusing on their structures, adhesive mechanisms, advantages, limitations, and current applications. The bioinspired adhesives have numerous advantages over traditional adhesives, which will be a wise direction for achieving tissue adhesives with superior properties.},

Comfort and fit are important while wearing an FFR. This paper proposes a novel technology to produce customized face seal design for improving the wearing comfort and fit of FFR wearers. In order to customize the design of face seals, we scanned faces of three subjects using three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning method. A customized face seal for a 3M 8210 N95 FFR for each headform was designed using reverse engineering technique. Next, the face seal prototypes were fabricated with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic using the 3D printing method. A force sensing system based on Arduino Uno R3 was developed, and the force sensor of this system was inserted between the FFR and headform to measure contact pressure. Experimental results showed that the newly designed FFR face seal provided the subjects with an improved contact pressure.},

	abstract = {Vaccines are a critical clinical tool in preventing illness and death due to infectious diseases and are regularly administered to children and adults across the globe. In order to obtain full protection from many vaccines, an individual needs to receive multiple doses over the course of months. However, vaccine administration in developing countries is limited by the difﬁculty in consistently delivering a second or third dose, and some vaccines, including the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), must be injected more than once for efﬁcacy. In addition, IPV does not remain stable over time at elevated temperatures, such as those it would encounter over time in the body if it were to be injected as a single-administration vaccine. In this manuscript, we describe microspheres composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) that can encapsulate IPV along with stabilizing excipients and release immunogenic IPV over the course of several weeks. Additionally, pH-sensitive, cationic dopants such as Eudragit E polymer caused clinically relevant amounts of stable IPV release upon degradation of the PLGA matrix. Speciﬁcally, IPV was released in two separate bursts, mimicking the delivery of two boluses approximately one month apart. In one of our top formulations, 1.4, 1.1, and 1.2 doses of the IPV serotype 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were released within the ﬁrst few days from 50 mg of particles. During the delayed, second burst, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.6 doses of each serotype, respectively, were released; thus, 50 mg of these particles released approximately two clinical doses spaced a month apart. Immunization of rats with the leading microsphere formulation showed more robust and long-lasting humoral immune response compared to a single bolus injection and was statistically non-inferior from two bolus injections spaced 1 month apart. By minimizing the number of administrations of a vaccine, such as IPV, this technology can serve as a tool to aid in the eradication of polio and other infectious diseases for the improvement of global health.},

Here, we developed an injectable microparticle formulation of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) that releases multiple pulses of stable antigen over time. To accomplish this, we established an IPV stabilization strategy using cationic polymers for pH modulation to enhance traditional small-molecule–based stabilization methods. We investigated the mechanism of this strategy and showed that it was broadly applicable to all three antigens in IPV. Our lead formulations released two bursts of IPV 1 month apart, mimicking a typical vaccination schedule in the developing world. One injection of the controlled-release formulations elicited a similar or better neutralizing response in rats, considered the correlate of protection in humans, than multiple injections of liquid vaccine. This single-administration vaccine strategy has the potential to improve vaccine coverage in the developing world.},

	abstract = {We present a generic fabrication scheme to produce polymer microparticles with engineerable, complex shapes. The polymer particles are made from polyethylene glycol based hydrogels using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molding technique. A simple surface treatment is used to pattern the surface energy of the PDMS molds, engendering the recessed wells in the molds with a higher surface energy than that of the surface. The contrast in surface energy causes hydrogel precursor to wet only the inside of the molds, creating isolated particles after curing with UV light. This eliminates the formation of an interconnecting “scum” layer and allows for fabrication of well-deﬁned, independent particles. We discuss resolution limits for the approach and present a simple strategy for releasing the particles. Finally, to show how the fabrication technique is inherently compatible with further particle modiﬁcations, we also demonstrate magnetic functionalization of particles.},

Building on previous analyses (2) and using the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) global vaccination coverage estimates as of 2018, this report presents global, regional, and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends, including vaccination dropout rates. According to these estimates, global coverage with the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) remained relatively unchanged from 2010 (89\%) to 2018 (90\%). Global coverage with the third DTP dose (DTP3) followed a similar global trend to that of DTP1, remaining relatively consistent from 2010 (84\%) to 2018 (86\%) (3). Globally, 19.4 million children (14\%) were not fully vaccinated in 2018, and among them, 13.5 million (70\%) did not receive any DTP doses. Overall, dropout rates from DTP1 to DTP3 decreased globally from 6\% in 2010 to 4\% in 2018. Global coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) remained between 84\% and 86\% during 2010-2018. Among countries that offer a second MCV dose (MCV2) during the second year of life, coverage increased from 19\% in 2007 to 54\% in 2018; among countries offering MCV2 to older age groups (children aged 3-14 years), coverage also increased, from 36\% in 2007 to 69\% in 2018 (3). Globally, the estimated difference in coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 in 2018 was 17\%. However, among new and underused vaccines, global coverage increased from 2007 to 2018 for completed series of rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). To reach global vaccination coverage goals for vaccines recommended during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, tailored strategies that address local determinants for incomplete vaccination are needed, including targeting hard-to-reach and hard-to-vaccinate populations.},

More recently, other features have become equally or even more appealing, such as the adjuvancy of such microspheres and their ability to elicit cellular effector responses, so-called cytotoxic T-cell responses, in addition to antibody responses observed already in the very early studies. In this review, we intended to revisit microsphere-based vaccines designed for the parenteral route and attempted to outline major developmental issues, as well as to analyze immunological fundamentals and data associated with antigen delivery by microspheres.},

In view of preparing a microsphere-based tetanus vaccine for clinical trials, final candidate vaccine-formulations were pre-clinically optimised here. Specifically, the importance of particular materials and processing for the induction of neutralising antibodies in guinea pigs were examined. The most efficacious vaccines were small-sized ({\textless}5 μm), co-adjuvanted with admixed alum and fabricated from fast-degrading polymers. Interestingly, the immunogenicity was less influenced by the type of antigen-stabilising excipient, the number of microsphere populations mixed together, or the microencapsulation technology, i.e. spray-drying versus coacervation, used. On the basis of these, we plan to prepare clinical samples for safety and immunogenicity testing in man.},

Vaccination with these agents results in a limited infection, but measurable disease pathogenesis is usually avoided and recovery is complete. The resultant immune responses are protective against the fully virulent pathogens and long-term immunological memory is induced.

Vaccine effectiveness trials provide a more pragmatic perspective by addressing the performance of a vaccine under the ordinary conditions of a public health program, by capturing direct as well as indirect effects of vaccination, and by comprehensively addressing outcomes of public health concern. The use of effectiveness trials should enable more rational triaging of new vaccines for developing countries and may accelerate the introduction of new vaccines into public health practice by resolving speculative debates about practical costs and benefits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}(\textit{JAMA}. 1996;275:390-397){\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess the cost effectiveness of a meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccination campaign in 0-17 year olds. Design Cost effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the healthcare provider. Setting England and Wales. Main outcome measure Cost per life year saved. Results In 1998-9, immediately before the introduction of meningococcal C vaccination, the burden of serogroup C disease was considerable, with an estimated 1137 cases in people aged 0-17 years and at least 72 deaths. The vaccination campaign is estimated to have cost between £126m (\$180m, €207m) and £241m (\$343m, €395m), depending on the price of the vaccine. Under base case assumptions the cost per life year saved from the vaccination campaign is estimated to be £6259 (\$8919, €10 264). School based vaccination was more cost effective than general practice based vaccination because of lower delivery costs. Immunisation of infants aged under 1 year was the least cost effective component of the campaign because, although this maximises the life years gained, the three dose schedule required is more expensive than other methods of delivery. Estimates of the cost per life year saved were sensitive to assumptions on the future incidence of disease and the case fatality ratio. Conclusions Meningococcal C vaccination is likely to be more cost effective in all age groups when the incidence of disease is high. It is also more cost effective when given to children aged 1-4 (by general practitioners) and to children and young people aged 5-17 years at school than when administered to infants under 12 months of age or youths aged 16-17 years who are not at school.},

	abstract = {Immunization prevents over 3 million child deaths from vaccine preventable diseases such as diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles and polio every year. New vaccines against respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases have the potential to prevent an additional 8 million deaths. Assuring that the existing and new vaccines are available to all children in the world is a global health priority. The health benefits of new vaccines like hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) are indisputable. In the case of hepatitis B, over 1.2 millions deaths could be prevented each year if children and at risk adults were immunized with the hepatitis B vaccine. However, despite the clear health need and benefit, many countries have been unable to provide the `new' vaccines, like hepatitis B vaccine, to their populations. For these countries, the limitation is not the delivery structure. Most countries now have immunization delivery structures which can provide immediate access to 80\% of the country's new-borns. Nor is it the vaccine availability as adequate capacity exists to meet the demand. The limitation has been the inability of governments to finance the vaccine because of a combination of factors including dependence on donors, donor policy, inadequate recognition by governments of the value of vaccines and, for some countries, the absolute price of the vaccines. The successes and failures in introducing a `new' vaccine like hepatitis B vaccine into the world have clearly illustrated that it is economics and not epidemiology which dictates introduction of the vaccine into national immunization programmes. UNICEF and the WHO Global Programme for Vaccines and Immunization (GPV), have now developed and adopted a framework which differentiates countries based on their capacity to be financially self-sufficient for their vaccine needs. This framework forms the basis of strategies designed to co-ordinate the actions of governments, donors, agencies and vaccine manufacturers in order to ensure all countries have rapid access to affordable vaccines.},

The chemical (oxidation, deamidation, hydrolysis) and physical (unfolding, aggregation) changes of proteins during the formulation process and storage not only reduce biological activity, but they can cause adverse reactions, such as immune responses, even when the total protein population is at a low level (Table 1) (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Developing new formulations that maintain the integrity of the purified protein during the manufacturing process, delivery, and 1–2 yr of storage is a minimum requisite for bringing protein pharmaceuticals to the market. Aqueous solutions that are ready for injection are often the most convenient and preferable dosage forms for therapeutic proteins, whereas many purified proteins are not stable enough in the solutions to meet the shelf-life requirements, even when they are stored at low temperatures.

Nanoparticles were prepared by the double emulsion method (w/o/w), using methylene chloride as an organic solvent and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or human serum albumin (HSA) as a surfactant. The influence of experimental constraints such as sonication and organic solvent on protein C activity was evaluated. It appears that a short time of sonication as well as the addition of acetone to methylene chloride (1/1) limited the lost of protein C activity. The study of protein C adsorption on blank PLA nanoparticles gave evidence to hydrophobic interactions between these two entities. The increase in PLA molecular weight on the characteristics of the protein C-loaded nanoparticles led to both a slightly decreased particle size and a lower polydispersity index, whereas the entrapment efficiency of protein C was not affected. The use of HSA as a surfactant allowed the increase in the entrapment efficiency of protein C but prevented its release. Finally, the evaluation of the activity of released protein C clearly illustrates that it was disturbed during the nanoparticle preparation. Thus, the obtained results emphasize the potential of protein C-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles for protein progressive delivery in plasma.},

	abstract = {A critical problem in the storage and delivery of pharmaceutical proteins is their aggregation induced by moisture. A model system has been elaborated and investigated to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon. When 10 mg of bovine serum albumin lyophilized from an aqueous solution of pH 7.3 are wetted with just 3 μL of a buffered physiological saline solution and incubated in the solid state at 37°C, the protein progressively loses its solubility in water; e.g., after a 24 h incubation 97\% of the protein becomes insoluble. This moisture-induced aggregation of albumin has been discovered to be due to an intermolecular S—S bond formation via the thiol-disulfide interchange reaction. The dependence of the extent of the solid-state aggregation on the amount and mode of addition of moisture and the atmosphere, additives, temperature, and history of the protein powder have been investigated. The moisture-induced solid-state aggregation has also been established and studied for three other lyophilized proteins: ovalbumin, glucose oxidase, and β-lactoglobulin. In all cases, the loss of solubility is caused by thiol-disulfide interchange either alone or in combination with a conformational (noncovalent) process. The aggregation can be minimized by lyophilizing the proteins from acidic aqueous solutions, by adding inorganic salts, by co-lyophilizing the proteins with water-soluble polymers, or by controlling the moisture content at optimal levels.},

A major obstacle to development of these polymers is the need to retain the structure and biological activity of encapsulated proteins during months of incubation under physiological conditions. We encapsulated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in injectable poly(DL-lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA) 50/50 cylindrical implants and determined the mechanism of BSA instability. Simulations of the polymer microclimate revealed that moisture and acidic pH ({\textless}3) triggered unfolding of encapsulated BSA, resulting in peptide bond hydrolysis and noncovalent aggregation. To neutralize the acids liberated by the biodegradable lactic/glycolic acid-based polyester, we coincorporated into the polymer an antacid, Mg(OH)2, which increased microclimate pH and prevented BSA structural losses and aggregation for over one month. We successfully applied this stabilization approach in both cylinder- and microsphere-injectable configurations and for delivery of angiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor and bone-regenerating bone morphogenetic protein-2.},

The analysis provides starting points for changes that could enhance coverage and sustainability. Such changes include alterations in program design and adjustments in the views of different categories of program staff. The article discusses strategies directed at achieving such changes.},

In this work, the ability of a combination nanovaccine containing both recombinant hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein to provide protection against seasonal influenza virus infection was examined in young and aged mice. Vaccine formulations combining two nanoadjuvants, polyanhydride nanoparticles and pentablock copolymer micelles, were shown to enhance protection against challenge compared to each adjuvant alone in young mice. Nanoparticles were shown to enhance in vitro activation of dendritic cells isolated from aged mice, while both nanoadjuvants did not induce proinflammatory cytokine secretion which may be detrimental in aged individuals. In addition, the combination nanovaccine platform was shown to induce demonstrable antibody titers in both young and aged mice that correlated with the maintenance of body weight post-challenge. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the combination nanovaccine platform is a promising technology for influenza vaccines for older adults.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.12.008},
	abstract = {Background
Microneedle patch (MNP) technology is designed to simplify the process of vaccine administration; however, depending on its characteristics, MNP technology may provide additional benefits beyond the point-of-use, particularly for vaccine supply chains.
Methods
Using the HERMES modeling software, we examined replacing four routine vaccines – Measles-containing vaccine (MCV), Tetanus toxoid (TT), Rotavirus (Rota) and Pentavalent (Penta) – with MNP versions in the routine vaccine supply chains of Benin, Bihar (India), and Mozambique.
Results
Replacing MCV with an MNP (5 cm3-per-dose, 2-month thermostability, current single-dose price-per-dose) improved MCV availability by 13\%, 1\% and 6\% in Benin, Bihar and Mozambique, respectively, and total vaccine availability by 1\% in Benin and Mozambique, while increasing the total cost per dose administered by \$0.07 in Benin, \$0.56 in Bihar and \$0.11 in Mozambique. Replacing TT with an MNP improved TT and total vaccine availability (3\% and {\textless}1\%) in Mozambique only, when the patch was 5 cm3 and 2-months thermostable but increased total cost per dose administered by \$0.14. Replacing Rota with an MNP (at 5–15 cm3-per-dose, 1–2 month thermostable) improved Rota and total vaccine availability, but only improved Rota vaccine availability in Bihar (at 5 cm3, 1–2 months thermostable), while decreasing total vaccine availability by 1\%. Finally, replacing Penta with an MNP (at 5 cm3, 2-months thermostable) improved Penta vaccine availability by 1–8\% and total availability by {\textless}1–9\%.
Conclusions
An MNP for MCV, TT, Rota, or Penta would need to have a smaller or equal volume-per-dose than existing vaccine formulations and be able to be stored outside the cold chain for a continuous period of at least two months to provide additional benefits to all three supply chains under modeled conditions.},

	abstract = {Developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVMs) supply over half of the vaccines used in developing country immunisation programs. Decisions by developing countries to establish vaccine manufacturing should be based on economic viability, however reliable assessments of vaccine production costs are lacking. This study aimed to quantify the cost of establishing vaccine manufacturing facilities and producing vaccines in developing countries. This study estimates vaccine production costs in developing countries based on twelve vaccines produced by eight DCVMs. The results were based on estimates of the capital and operating costs required to establish vaccine manufacturing facilities under three hypothetical scenarios of production scale and scope. Cost patterns were then compared to vaccine prices paid by countries in both industrialized and developing country markets. The cost of producing vaccines in developing countries was estimated to be on average US\$ 2.18 per dose, ranging between US\$ 0.98 and US\$ 4.85 for different vaccine types and formulations. Vaccine costs-per-dose decrease as production scale and scope increase. Cost-per-dose is mainly driven by fixed costs, but at a scale of production over 20 million doses per year it becomes driven by variable costs. Under the three hypothetical scenarios used, costs-per-dose of vaccines produced by developing countries were around 47\% lower than vaccine prices in developing-country markets and 84\% lower than prices in industrialized-country markets. This study has found that local production of vaccines in developing countries exhibits both economies of scale and economies of scope. The lower costs relative to prices suggests that a producer surplus and potential profits may be attainable in both developing and developed country markets, supporting sustainable production.},

In June 2015, a cholera outbreak occurred in Juba, South Sudan, and because of the global shortage of oral cholera vaccine, authorities were unable to secure sufficient doses to vaccinate the entire at-risk population—approximately 1 million people. In this Personal View, we document the first public health use of a reduced, single-dose regimen of oral cholera vaccine, and show the details of the decision-making process and timeline. We also make recommendations to help improve reactive vaccination campaigns against cholera, and discuss the importance of new and flexible context-specific dose regimens and vaccination strategies.},

We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that macaques had high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, humoral and cellular immune responses, and pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. Following initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with primary infection. Anamnestic immune responses following rechallenge suggested that protection was mediated by immunologic control.

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and impacted global healthcare systems and economy1,2. A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development. We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi. Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naïve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.},

SARS-CoV-specific serum and mucosal immunoglobulins were readily detected in immunized animals. Serum IgG blocked binding of the S-protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Entry into human B cell lines occurred in a FcγRII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion indicating that ADE of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV. Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with SARS-CoV. Altogether our results indicate that a recombinant trimeric S protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in vivo and warrant concern in the safety evaluation of a human vaccine against SARS-CoV.},

	abstract = {Small animal models are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of candidate vaccines and antivirals directed against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV). We investigated the ability of SARS CoV to infect 5-week-old Golden Syrian hamsters. When administered intranasally, SARS CoV replicates to high titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. Peak replication in the lower respiratory tract was noted on day 2 postinfection (p.i.) and was cleared by day 7 p.i. Low levels of virus were present in the nasal turbinates of a few hamsters at 14 days p.i. Viral replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was accompanied by cellular necrosis early in infection, followed by an inflammatory response coincident with viral clearance, focal consolidation in pulmonary tissue, and eventual pulmonary tissue repair. Despite high levels of virus replication and associated pathology in the respiratory tract, the hamsters showed no evidence of disease. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera at day 7 p.i., and mean titers at day 28 p.i. exceeded 1:400. Hamsters challenged with SARS CoV at day 28 p.i. were completely protected from virus replication and accompanying pathology in the respiratory tract. Comparing these data to the mouse model, SARS CoV replicates to a higher titer and for a longer duration in the respiratory tract of hamsters and is accompanied by significant pathology that is absent in mice. Viremia and extrapulmonary spread of SARS CoV to liver and spleen, which are seen in hamsters, were not detected in mice. The hamster, therefore, is superior to the mouse as a model for the evaluation of antiviral agents and candidate vaccines against SARS CoV replication.},

To successfully administer nucleic acids, one approach is to encapsulate them in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, LNPs administered intravenously substantially accumulate in the liver where they are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Here, we administer prior to the LNPs a liposome designed to transiently occupy liver cells, the Nanoprimer. This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreases the LNPs’ uptake by the RES. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improves the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32\%) or FVII silencing (by 49\%). The use of the Nanoprimer offers a new strategy to improve the systemic delivery of RNA-based therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Tissue adhesion is a severe postoperative complication. Various strategies have been developed to minimize postoperative adhesion, but the clinical efficacy is still far from satisfactory. Herein, we present a dual dynamically crosslinked hydrogel to serve as a physical postoperative anti-adhesion barrier. The hydrogel was generated by dynamic chemical oxime bonding from alkoxyamine-terminated Pluronic F127 (AOP127) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA), as well as hydrophobic association of AOP127. Rheological analysis demonstrated that the hydrogel exhibits temperature sensitivity. At 37 °C, it shows much higher modulus and higher stability than the Pluronic F127 hydrogel. Hemolytic assays suggested that the hydrogel undergoes low hemolysis. In addition, it exhibited anti-adhesion to blood cells in blood cell adhesion tests. It also showed an anti-attachment effect to fibroblasts and biocompatibility in vitro cell studies. Macroscopic evaluation and lap-shear tests revealed that the hydrogel has a moderate adhesive capacity to tissue, which is important for self-fixation. A rat model of sidewall defect-bowel abrasion was established to evaluate the anti-adhesion effect in vivo. The gross observation and pathological analysis revealed a significant reduction in postoperative peritoneal adhesion in the AOP127/OHA hydrogel-treated group than those treated with normal saline or Pluronic F127 hydrogel. Hence, the dual dynamically crosslinked hydrogel with self-fixable capacity may be suitable as a physical barrier for postoperative adhesion prevention.
Statement of Significance
Despite the development of numerous postoperative anti-adhesion barriers, their anti-adhesion efficacy is still limited in clinical trials due to poor tissue adhesion and rapid clearance from injured areas. Herein, we have developed a dual dynamic crosslinked hydrogel, generated by dynamic oxime bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The hydrogel is temperature-sensitive and demonstrates moderate tissue adhesion capacity, which allows for self-fixation when applied to defects. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds improves the stability of the hydrogel. Moreover, the hydrogel not only displays appropriate hemocompatibility, cytocompatibility and anti-adhesion of blood cells and fibroblasts, but it also effectively contributes to preventing postoperative peritoneal adhesions in vivo. Hence, this dual dynamic crosslinked hydrogel may have potential applications as a physical barrier in clinical practice.},

The polymerization was studied using spectroscopy, microscopy, and scattering techniques and was modeled numerically. The model made predictions of the degree of polymerization and size distribution of the assembled products, and suggested the potential for branching at hybridization junctions, all of which were confirmed experimentally.

	abstract = {Tissue adhesives play a vital role in surgical processes as a substitute for sutures in wound closure. However, several existing tissue adhesives suffer from cell toxicity, weak tissue-adhesive strength, and high cost. In this study, by taking advantage of the fast and specific inverse-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction, a series of bioadhesives were produced by employing copper-free click chemistry pair trans-cyclooctene (TCO) /tetrazine (Tz) in chitosan. The gelation time of the bioadhesives can be optimized to be less than 2 minutes, which meets the need for surgical wound closure in practice. By adding 4-arm polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde (PEG-PALD) as a co-crosslinker, the adhesive strength of the bioadhesives was optimized to be 2.3 times higher than that of the conventional fibrin glue. Moreover, by adjusting the amount of the co-crosslinker, the swelling ratio and pore size of the chitosan bioadhesives can be tuned to fit the need of drug encapsulation and cell seeding. The chitosan bioadhesives possess no significant in vitro cytotoxicity. Using a mice skin incision wound model, we found that the chitosan bioadhesives were able to close the wound faster and promote wound healing process than the fibrin glue. In conclusion, our results support that the innovative click-chemistry based bioadhesives have been developed with improved physical and biological properties for surgical wound closures.
Statement of Significance
The manuscript describes a new group of click chemistry-based chitosan bioadhesives fabricated by reacting copper-free click chemistry pair trans-cyclooctene/tetrazine with co-crosslinker PEG-PALD. The new bioadhesives possess the properties of simple preparation, injectability, fast gelation, a minimal cytotoxicity, strong adhesive strength to tissue, and enhanced wound healing responses. This innovative strategy may draw interests of readers from the field of biomaterials, drug delivery, surgical device, and translational medicine.},

This strategy employs automated and operationally simple chromatographic separation that is demonstrated to be applicable to a variety of block copolymer chemistries on multigram scales with excellent mass recovery. The corresponding phase diagrams exhibit increased compositional resolution compared to those traditionally constructed via multiple, individual block copolymer syntheses. Increased uniformity and lower dispersity of the chromatographic libraries lead to differences in the location of order–order transitions and observable morphologies, highlighting the influence of dispersity on the self-assembly of block copolymers. Significantly, this separation technique greatly simplifies the exploration of block copolymer phase space across a range of compositions, monomer pairs, and molecular weights (up to 50000 amu), producing materials with increased control and homogeneity when compared to conventional strategies.},

Well-defined bottlebrush polymers with rubbery poly(4-methylcaprolactone) side chains were cross-linked in formulations that include a bislactone and strong Lewis acid (tin ethylhexanoate). The resulting materials exhibit tunable stress-relaxation rates at elevated temperatures (160–180 °C) due to dynamic ester cross-links that undergo transesterification with residual hydroxy groups. Varying the cross-linker loading or bottlebrush backbone degree of polymerization yields predictable low-frequency shear moduli ca. 10–100 kPa, well below values typical of linear polymer CANs (1 MPa). These extensible networks can be stretched to strains as large as 350\% before failure and undergo efficient self-healing to recover {\textgreater}85\% of their original toughness upon repeated fracture and melt processing. In summary, molecular architecture creates new opportunities to tailor the mechanical properties of CANs in ways that are otherwise difficult to achieve.},

	abstract = {, In this work, we propose the use
of regular branching of polyurethanes
as a way to regulate chain dynamics and govern crystallization in
highly dense hydrogen-bonded systems. As a result, robust and healable
polyurethanes can be obtained. To this end, we synthesized a range
of aliphatic propane diol derivatives with alkyl branches ranging
from butyl (C4) to octadecanyl (C18). The series of brush polyurethanes
was synthesized by polyaddition of the diols and hexamethylene diisocyanate.
Polyurethanes with very short (C {\textless} 4) and very long (C = 18) brush
lengths did not lead to any significant healing due to crystallization.
An intermediate amorphous regime appears for polymers with middle
branch lengths (C = 4 to 8) showing a fine control of material toughness.
For these systems, the side chain length regulates tube dilation,
and significant macroscopic healing of cut samples was observed and
studied in detail using melt rheology and tensile testing. Despite
the high healing degrees observed immediately after repair, it was
found that samples with medium to long length brushes lost their interfacial
strength at the healed site after being heated to the healing temperature
for some time after the optimal time to reach full healing. Dedicated
testing suggests that annealed samples, while keeping initial tackiness,
are not able to completely heal the cut interface. We attribute such
behavior to annealing-induced interfacial crystallization promoted
by the aliphatic branches. Interestingly, no such loss of healing
due to annealing was observed for samples synthesized with C4 and
C7 diols, which is identified as the optimal healing regime. These
results point at the positive effect of branching on healing, provided
that a critical chain length is not surpassed, as well as the need
to study healing behavior long after the optimal healing times.},

controlled through the potassium concentration. This approach provides
a new window into critical microstructural parameters, in particular
identifying the mechanism by which potassium and calcium ions are
recruited as a powerful viscosity control in silk. Our model constitutes

	abstract = {, The number of biomedical applications
of hydrogels is increasing
rapidly on account of their unique physical, structural, and mechanical
properties. The utility of hydrogels as drug delivery systems or tissue
engineering scaffolds critically depends on the control of diffusion
of solutes through the hydrogel matrix. Predicting or even modeling
this diffusion is challenging due to the complex structure of hydrogels.
Currently, the diffusivity of solutes in hydrogels is typically modeled
by one of three main theories proceeding from distinct diffusion mechanisms:
(i) hydrodynamic, (ii) free volume, and (iii) obstruction theory.
Yet, a comprehensive predictive model is lacking. Thus, time and capital-intensive
trial-and-error procedures are used to test the viability of hydrogel
applications. In this work, we have developed a model for the diffusivity
of solutes in hydrogels combining the three main theoretical frameworks,
which we call the multiscale diffusion model (MSDM). We verified the
MSDM by analyzing the diffusivity of dextran of different sizes in
a series of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with distinct mesh
sizes. We measured the subnanoscopic free volume by positron annihilation
lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to characterize the physical hierarchy
of these materials. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of literature
data from previous studies on the diffusion of solutes in hydrogels.
The model presented outperforms traditional models in predicting solute
diffusivity in hydrogels and provides a practical approach to predicting
the transport properties of solutes such as drugs through hydrogels
used in many biomedical applications.},

that the high Tg of the PS core was largely
unaffected by the presence of an outer polymer shell, whereas the
lower Tg of the PBMA shell layer decreased
with increasing PBMA thickness. The surface mobility was revealed
at a temperature about 15 K lower than the Tg of the PBMA shell layer. Overall, the modulus of the core–shell
nanoparticles decreased with increasing PBMA shell layer thickness.
These results suggest that the nanoparticle modulus and Tg can be tuned independently through the control of nanoparticle

The use of lipid nanoparticles as a drug delivery approach improves the payloads' stability, pharmacokinetics, bio-distribution and therapeutic benefit while reducing side effects. Moreover, a wide variety of targeting moieties allow a precise and modular manipulation of gene expression, together with the ability to identify and selectively affect disease-relevant leukocytes-subsets.

Little improvement is seen with standard surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Clinical progress is hampered by the inability to detect and target glioblastoma disease reservoirs based on a diffuse invasive pattern and the presence of molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity. The goal of this study was to target the invasive and stem-like glioblastoma cells that evade first-line treatments using agents capable of delivering imaging enhancers or biotherapeutic cargo. To accomplish this, a combinatorial phage display library was biopanned against glioblastoma cell model systems that accurately recapitulate the intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and infiltrative nature of the disease. Candidate peptides were screened for specificity and ability to target glioblastoma cells in vivo. Cargo-conjugated peptides delivered contrast-enhancing agents to highly infiltrative tumor populations in intracranial xenograft models without the obvious need for blood brain barrier disruption. Simultaneous use of five independent targeting peptides provided greater coverage of this complex tumor and selected peptides have the capacity to deliver a therapeutic cargo (oncolytic virus VSVΔM51) to the tumor cells in vivo. Herein, we have identified a series of peptides with utility as an innovative platform to assist in targeting glioblastoma for the purpose of diagnostic or prognostic imaging, image-guided surgery, and/or improved delivery of therapeutic agents to glioblastoma cells implicated in disease relapse.},

We performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using aligned or randomly oriented polycaprolactone nanofiber substrates in both mechanically loaded and unloaded conditions. Across all experiments a disorganized biomaterial fiber topography was alone sufficient to promote a pro-inflammatory signature in macrophages, tendon fibroblasts, and tendon tissue. Extrinsic mechanical loading was found to strongly regulate the character of this signature by reducing pro-inflammatory markers both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that macrophages generally displayed a stronger response to biophysical cues than tendon fibroblasts, with dominant effects of cross-talk between these cell types observed in mechanical co-culture models. Collectively our data suggest that macrophages play a potentially important role as mechanosensory cells in tendon repair, and provide insight into how biological response might be therapeutically modulated by rational biomaterial designs that address the biomechanical niche of recruited cells.},

Reconstruction of osteochondral defects requires difunctional scaffolds that simultaneously induce cartilage and subchondral bone morphogenesis, however, high-performance cartilage reconstructive scaffolds remain a considerable challenge. In this study, a solvent-free urethane crosslinking and spontaneous pore-forming procedure under room temperature was proposed and optimized to produce PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS) scaffolds with controllable crosslinking degrees and hierarchical macro-/micro-porosities. Based on the economical and feasible preparative approach, the viscoelastic PEGS-12h with low crosslinking degree was demonstrated to significantly stimulate chondrogenic differentiation, maintain chondrocyte phenotype and enhance cartilage matrix secretion compared to elastic polymer with high crosslinking degree, emphasizing the importance of matrix viscoelasticity in cartilage regeneration. On this basis, the viscoelastic low-crosslinked PEGS-12h was combined with the well-acknowledged osteoinductive mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) to construct a difunctional PEGS/MBG bilayer scaffold, and evaluated in a full-thickness osteochondral defect model in vivo. The PEGS/MBG bilayer scaffold successfully reconstructed well-integrated articular hyaline cartilage and its subchondral bone in 12 weeks, exhibiting extraordinary regenerative efficiency. The results indicated that the viscoelastic PEGS scaffold and PEGS/MBG bilayer scaffold proposed in this study made an excellent candidate for cartilage and osteochondral regeneration, and was expected for clinical translation in the future.},

Reliable methods to induce microvascular networks in such microphysiological systems are needed to improve the size and physiological function of these models. By systematically engineering several physical and biomolecular properties of the cellular microenvironment (including crosslinking density, polymer density, adhesion ligand concentration, and degradability), we establish design principles that describe how synthetic matrix properties influence vascular morphogenesis in modular and tunable hydrogels based on commercial 8-arm poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG8a) macromers. We apply these design principles to generate endothelial networks that exhibit consistent morphology throughout depths of hydrogel greater than 1 mm. These PEG8a-based hydrogels have relatively high volumetric swelling ratios ({\textgreater}1.5), which limits their utility in confined environments such as microfluidic devices. To overcome this limitation, we mitigate swelling by incorporating a highly functional PEG-grafted alpha-helical poly (propargyl-l-glutamate) (PPLGgPEG) macromer along with the canonical 8-arm PEG8a macromer in gel formation. This hydrogel platform supports enhanced endothelial morphogenesis in neutral-swelling environments. Finally, we incorporate PEG8a-PPLGgPEG gels into microfluidic devices and demonstrate improved diffusion kinetics and microvascular network formation in situ compared to PEG8a-based gels.},

These pairs must be orthogonal to both the host synthetases and tRNAs and to each other. Pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/PyltRNA pairs are the most widely used system for genetic code expansion. Here, we reveal that the sequences of ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA pairs (which lack N-terminal domains) form two distinct classes. We show that the measured specificities of the ΔNPylRSs and ΔNPyltRNAs correlate with sequence-based clustering, and most ΔNPylRSs preferentially function with ΔNPyltRNAs from their class. We then identify 18 mutually orthogonal pairs from the 88 ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA combinations tested. Moreover, we generate a set of 12 triply orthogonal pairs, each composed of three new PylRS/PyltRNA pairs. Finally, we diverge the ncAA specificity and decoding properties of each pair, within a triply orthogonal set, and direct the incorporation of three distinct non-canonical amino acids into a single polypeptide.},

	abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived matrices such as Matrigel are used to culture numerous cell types in vitro as they recapitulate ECM properties that support cell growth, organisation, migration and differentiation. These ECM-derived matrices contain various growth factors which make them highly bioactive. However, they suffer lot-to-lot variability, undefined composition and lack of controlled physical properties. There is a need to develop rationally designed biomaterials that can also recapitulate ECM roles. Here, we report the development of fibronectin (FN)-based 3D hydrogels of controlled stiffness and degradability that incorporate full-length FN to enable solid-phase presentation of growth factors in a physiological manner. We demonstrate, in vitro and in vivo, the effect of incorporating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in these hydrogels to enhance angiogenesis and bone regeneration, respectively. These hydrogels represent a step-change in the design of well-defined, reproducible, synthetic microenvironments for 3D cell culture that incorporate growth factors to achieve functional effects.},

	abstract = {Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines are highly advantageous, as they result in enhanced protein expression compared to mRNA (mRNA), thus minimizing the required dose. However, previous delivery strategies were optimized for siRNA or mRNA and do not necessarily deliver saRNA efficiently due to structural differences of these RNAs, thus motivating the development of saRNA delivery platforms. Here, we engineer a bioreducible, linear, cationic polymer called “pABOL” for saRNA delivery and show that increasing its molecular weight enhances delivery both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that pABOL enhances protein expression and cellular uptake via both intramuscular and intradermal injection compared to commercially available polymers in vivo and that intramuscular injection confers complete protection against influenza challenge. Due to the scalability of polymer synthesis and ease of formulation preparation, we anticipate that this polymer is highly clinically translatable as a delivery vehicle for saRNA for both vaccines and therapeutics.},

The standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy depletes AML cells to induce remission, but is infrequently curative. An immunosuppressive AML microenvironment in the bone marrow and the paucity of suitable immunotherapy targets limit the induction of effective immune responses. Here, in mouse models of AML, we show that a macroporous-biomaterial vaccine that delivers the cytokine granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the Toll-like-receptor-9 agonist cytosine–guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide and one or multiple leukaemia antigens (in the form of a defined peptide antigen, cell lysates or antigens sourced from AML cells recruited in vivo) induces local immune-cell infiltration and activated dendritic cells, evoking a potent anti-AML response. The biomaterial-based vaccine prevented the engraftment of AML cells when administered as a prophylactic and when combined with chemotherapy, and eradicated established AML even in the absence of a defined vaccine antigen. Biomaterial-based AML vaccination can induce potent immune responses, deplete AML cells and prevent disease relapse.},

The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of DTPa-IPV/Hib compared to DTPa-IPV+Hib vaccines in terms of immune responses to all vaccine antigens, 1 month post-dose 3. Solicited symptoms (local and general) were recorded during 4 days, and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) during 31 days, after each vaccination. Serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study duration.The immunogenicity of the pentavalent DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine was non-inferior compared to concomitant administration of DTPa-IPV+Hib vaccines. One month post-dose 3, nearly all infants had antibody levels above the seroprotective thresholds for anti-diphtheria toxoid, anti-tetanus toxoid, anti-polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate, and anti-poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3, and had antibody levels above the seropositive thresholds for anti-pertussis toxoid (PT), anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and anti-pertactin (PRN) antibodies. A vaccine response for PT, FHA and PRN was observed in at least 96.7\% of study participants. Anti-PRP geometric mean concentrations appeared lower for the DTPa-IPV/Hib group (8.456 µg/mL) than for the DTPa-IPV+Hib group (18.700 µg/mL). In both groups, the most common solicited symptoms were injection site redness and irritability. Fifty-seven SAEs were reported throughout the study; none were considered to be vaccination related.},

	abstract = {For middle and low-income countries, the cost of HPV vaccines remains challenging. We conducted an open-label nonrandomized clinical trial evaluating immune response to the HPV–16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered on a standard (months (M) 0–1–6) versus extended schedule (M 0–6–60) at 7, 21, 60, 72 and 120 months post-vaccination. Participants were females recruited in Morelos, Mexico: 474 girls aged 9–10 years and 500 women aged 18–24 years receiving a standard schedule, and 1026 girls aged 9–10 years receiving an extended schedule (currently the girls in the extended schedule had received only the first 2 doses). This report presents the interim analysis results for non-inferiority between the regimes conducted with the current available data at 21 months after the first dose, with serum antibodies assessed by ELISA. A pre-stated margin of non-inferiority was defined by post-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (upper 95\% confidence interval [CI]≤2.0) between the standard and the two-dose schedule in girls at month 21. Immune response to the vaccine was strongest in adolescent girls and in the 3-dose group. Statistical non-inferiority of the two-dose versus three-dose groups was demonstrated. At 21 months, comparing the adolescent 2-dose versus 3-dose groups, the GMT ratio and 95\% CI were 1.66 (1.55–1.81) and 1.67 (1.51–1.86) for HPV16 and 18, respectively. The two-dose regimen was non-inferior when compared to the three-dose response in same-age girls and with women aged 18–24 years after 21 months of follow-up. The reduction in the number of doses from the current three-dose schedule may lower overall costs associated with the vaccination and increase accessibility and compliance with the recommended dosing of the HPV vaccine.},

The antigen amounts in the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines were higher in the Swedish than in the US arm while the amounts in the other vaccines were the same in both arms. There were no serious side effects. Local reactions increased with the numbers of doses but did not differ significantly between the groups. Serum was obtained at 2, 7, 15 and 16 months in the US arm and at 3, 6, 12 and 13 months of age in the Swedish arm. A fifth serum was obtained in both groups at 4 yr of age. For vaccines with the same antigen amount the following was observed: a. three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months were more immunogenic than two doses at 3 and 5 months; b. the third dose in the Swedish arm was more immunogenic than the third dose in the US arm; c. the fourth dose in the US arm induced higher antibodies than the third dose in the Swedish arm (except for pertussis toxin antibodies that were similar in both groups) and the differences tended to remain at the age of 4 yr. Children in the Swedish arm received a higher diphtheria toxoid dose (25 Lf) than in the US arm (15 Lf) which led to higher diphtheria toxin antibodies in the Swedish arm at comparable ages. Children in the Swedish arm received a higher tetanus toxoid dose (7 Lf) than in the US arm (6 Lf). Tetanus antibodies were similar at comparable ages. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of vaccines in infancy can be improved by increasing the number of doses, by prolonging the intervals between doses and by increasing the antigen amount in the vaccine.},

A total of 606 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either PCV13 or PCV7 at 3, 5, and 11 months of age; all subjects concomitantly received diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated polio-Haemophilus influenzae type B (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib) vaccine. Vaccine reactions were monitored. Antibody responses to DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib antigens, serotype-specific anticapsular polysaccharide IgG responses, and antipneumococcal opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) activity were measured 1 month after the two-dose primary series and 1 month after the toddler dose. Overall, the safety profile of PCV13 was similar to that of PCV7. The response to DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib antigens was substantially the same with both PCV13 and PCV7. PCV13 elicited antipneumococcal capsular IgG antibodies to all 13 vaccine serotypes, with notable increases in concentrations seen after the toddler dose. Despite a lower immunogenicity for serotypes 6B and 23F after the primary series of PCV13, responses to the seven common serotypes were comparable between the PCV13 and PCV7 groups when measured after the toddler dose. PCV13 also elicited substantial levels of OPA activity against all 13 serotypes following both the infant series and the toddler dose. In conclusion, PCV13 appeared comparable to PCV7 in safety profile and immunogenicity for common serotypes, demonstrated functional OPA responses for all 13 serotypes, and did not interfere with immune responses to concomitantly administered DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine.},

	abstract = {Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were first licensed as a three-dose series; a two-dose series is now recommended in some age groups and there is interest in possible one-dose vaccination.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review of HPV vaccine effectiveness by number of doses, including assessment of biases and impact of varying buffer periods (time between vaccination and outcome counting).
Results
Of 3787 articles identified, 26 full articles were assessed and 14 included in our review. All studies were conducted within the context of recommended three-dose schedules of bivalent (3) or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (11). Two evaluated effectiveness for prevention of HPV prevalence, six anogenital warts, and six abnormal cervical cytology or histology. Many studies found differences between three-, two- and one-dose vaccine recipients, indicating possible differences in HPV exposure prior to vaccination or in risk behavior. Adjusted or stratified analyses were conducted to control for potential confounding. All studies found significant vaccine effectiveness with three doses, 11 with two doses at various intervals, and six with one dose. Most studies showed a relationship (not always statistically significant) between effectiveness and number of doses, with greater decreases in HPV-related outcomes with three, followed by two and one dose(s). Few studies conducted formal comparisons of three vs fewer doses. Three of four studies that examined buffer periods found higher effectiveness and a smaller difference by number of doses with longer periods.
Conclusion
Most post-licensure studies report highest effectiveness with three doses; some found no statistically significant difference between two and three doses. Additionally, almost half found some effectiveness with one dose. Several biases impact estimates, with most biasing two- and one-dose results away from showing effectiveness. Future effectiveness studies, examining persons vaccinated prior to sexual activity and using methods to reduce potential sources of bias, can help inform vaccination policy.},

	abstract = {Infants aged under one year are at the highest risk of severe complications or death from pertussis infection. Prompt vaccination with a three dose course at two, three and four months of age decreases the amount of time they are vulnerable following waning of maternal antibodies. In Wales, uptake of all three doses of the primary course of pertussis containing vaccine is high. However, timeliness and equity at a population level have not been previously reported. This analysis included 163,733 children born from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2017. In this cohort 87.9\% received the first dose of a pertussis containing vaccine by 12 weeks of age, 87.1\% had received all three doses by 24 weeks of age, and 96.3\% received three doses by 52 weeks of age. Differences in uptake between those living in the most deprived and least deprived quintiles of Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) were smaller than differences in timeliness, but statistically significant. In 2017 the difference in timely uptake between those living in the most and least deprived quintiles was 4\%, 5\% and 7\% for doses one, two and three respectively. There was a difference of 10\% in the proportion of infants receiving all three primary vaccinations on time between the most and least deprived quintile of LSOAs. Consideration is needed on interventions that will help improve timeliness such as enhanced follow up of defaulters, electronic communication between primary care data systems, enhanced health visitor intervention and opportunistic vaccination in those who fail to attend scheduled vaccination appointments. There is also the need for routine monitoring of timeliness and further research into what influences delayed vaccination.},

This study assessed coverage (receiving at least one dose or full dose series) in eligible infants, compliance (\% completing dose series and \% completing series on schedule) in eligible infants vaccinated with Rotarix (2010) versus RotaTeq (2012), using Mexican Social Security Institute data nationwide and by regions.In 2010, 80.7\% received at least one dose of Rotarix, 75.6\% received both doses and 57.0\% received both doses on schedule. In 2012, 85.7\% received at least one dose of RotaTeq, 61.0\% received all three doses and 43.2\% received all three doses on schedule. More eligible infants received all doses with Rotarix versus RotaTeq (p {\textless} 0.001). Among infants vaccinated with Rotarix versus RotaTeq, 93.7\% versus 71.1\% completed full series (p {\textless} 0.001), and 75.5\% versus 70.9\% completed full series on schedule (p = 0.105), respectively. The full series coverage and compliance decreased in all regions with RotaTeq compared with Rotarix. In conclusion, rotavirus vaccination has successfully reduced morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years in Mexico. This study found significant differences in full series coverage and compliance among infants and a higher proportion of completed scheduled at an earlier age in Mexico when comparing a two-dose vaccine in 2010 with a three-dose vaccine in 2012. Such differences might need to be taken into consideration to maximize NIP benefits, including early protection of the rotavirus vaccination program.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Hoping to increase hepatitis B (HB) vaccination of adolescents, we did the following: 1) studied if modified regimens of the recombinant HB vaccine, Recombivax HB (2 or 3 doses of 5 or 10 μg given over 4 or 6 months), induce protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBsAb] levels (≥10 mIU/mL) comparable to the recommended regimen (5 μg at 0 and 1, and 6 months); 2) measured early antibody response after a single dose; and 3) assessed immunologic memory after 2- and 3-dose regimens.
Design. One thousand twenty-six adolescents were randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups (10 μg at 0 and 4 or 0 and 6 months; 5 μg at 0 and 6 or 0, 2, and 4 or 0, 1, and 6 months) in an open trial. Anti-HBsAb was measured in all participants just before and 1 month after the last dose, and at several other times in a subset of vaccinees. Anti-HBsAb response to a booster dose 2 years later was examined to assess immunologic memory in participants vaccinated with 5 μg at 0 and 6 or 0, 1, and 6 months.
Results. All regimens induced ≥10 mIU/mL of anti-HBs in ≥95\% of vaccinees. Geometric mean titers ranged from 674.8 to 3049.4 mIU/mL. Geometric mean titers were higher with regimens using the following: 1) 10 versus 5 μg; 2) 3 versus 2 doses; and 3) vaccination intervals of 6 versus 4 months. After 6 months, 63.8\% of vaccinees given one 10-μg dose had ≥10 mIU/mL of anti-HBsAb versus 41.6\% after one 5-μg dose. Participants vaccinated with either two or three 5-μg doses retained robust immunologic memory.
Conclusions. The results of this study show that a 2-dose regimen of Recombivax HB is as immunogenic and induces immunologic memory as effectively as the recommended 3-dose regimen. A regimen of two 10-μg doses may be of significant benefit for vaccinees who are poorly compliant or deviate from the intended vaccination schedule.},

	abstract = {Multiple vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on viral spike protein are under development. However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody responses generated with these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody responses induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we performed a qualitative study by immunizing rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213, lacking the RBD, as control). Resulting antibody quality and function were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), receptor binding domain (RBD) competition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) against different spike proteins in native conformation, and neutralization assays. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD), but not S2, generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination-induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike genome fragment phage display libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD, and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens; and antibody affinity correlated strongly with neutralization titers. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.},
